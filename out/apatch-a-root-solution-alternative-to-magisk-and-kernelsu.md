I've checked number of rooting softwares so far, a decade back we used to have plenty of rooting softwares to root Android devices basically smartphones, like Kingo root, Frama root, Super SU etc, as back in time a decade ago it's the beginning era of modern smartphones, at that time they used to have new early access hardware and software, which are emerging ones with astounding capabilities at the same time considering available technologies at that time they are powerful, advanced and 

and revolutionary as well, but as they are in early access they used to have a lot of bugs and security is not up to the mark in comparison to today's standards, due to that developers were able to simply find and exploit loop holes in hardware and mainly in software to modify parameters of them for various different purposes, but as time goes makers of them tightened and strengthened security of hardware and software of smartphones using a lot of technologies due to that now it became pretty hard and difficult to find loopholes and exploit them even in order to do that in present time requires unlocking of device bootloader compulsorily, in sense it's not easy as before, you must need external PC or device and has to be done carefully.

  

[\+ Why you should root your Android smartphone?](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/why-you-should-root-your-android.html)

  

Now a days, mobile makers by default powering up their smartphones with modern feature rich operating systems like HiOS, HyperOS, ColorOS, MIUI etc and software applications with such advanced features and options that a decade back we used to only get them when we root device for sure, including that to make things much easier now we also got to find no root methods to customize and modify operating system by getting access through android debug bridge aka adb commands and apps like Shizuku, though no root ways are not as powerful as root but they are pretty much enough for a lot of people to do more than a non root mode device, but thing is if you don't have stock feature rich operating system, and don't wanna root & engage in non root adb command based methods yet still we can get root level customizations through custom roms, which are developed by third party developers, in order to flash custom roms you need to have compatible device with unlocked bootloader after that with right guidelines you'll be able to flash any compatible custom roms through adb or using custom recovery like TWRP, at the end all this procedure seems complicated for newbies but once done quite worthy.

  

[\+ HiOS vs MIUI, which is best custom Android OS on smartphones?](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/03/hios-vs-miui-which-is-best-custom.html)

  

Even though, at present time we have many custom roms and no root methods which provide root level features and options on non rooted smartphones but at the end they may be not enough for some people especially geeks, due to various different reasons mainly because though some stock firmwares, third party custom roms and adb based methods may provide number of amazing features and options but still rooting provide full authority and way better different level experience, like basically with root you will get complete control of your smartphone as you can do almost anything on software and hardware from modifying system files, customizing graphical user interface, over-cloaking or under-cloaking CPU and GPU etc, what not you can unlock, remove any OEM based restrictions and limitations to gain access to everything which is not possible in non root mode, that's why rooted smartphone with it's plenty of benefits usually always have way better edge over non root ones but it all comes at the cost of some cons 

like as rooting can do anything in system level, modifying incorrectly can make the device unusable or irreparable including that it also voids statutory device warranty unless you live in EU aka european union.

  

[\+ Why you shouldn't root your Android smartphone?](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android.html)

  

There are number of rooting softwares based on operating systems available on smartphones, Android and iOS are most popular and widely used top operating systems for smartphones, though we can get system level access on both operating systems but on iOS rooting is known as jailbreak, if you're someone who owns iPhone then you may be familiar with jailbreaking iOS, anyhow both operating systems are from different makers and developed using different technologies, while Android is free and open source released and maintained by Google and iOS is a closed source by Apple inc. due to that we can't utilize same methods and software applications to get root access on them, but thing if the convenience of rooting smartphone is your top priority then it's better go with Android it's FOSS, so source code is publicly available online in form of AOSP, that makes things easier to find bugs and rooting Android powered smartphones, but when it comes to iOS powered iPhones as they're closed source software and hardware wise, it's not just difficult but also hard to jailbreak iOS, yet still thanks to skilled developers out there who somehow were able to find methods to jailbreak every latest version of iOS, at the end based on your needs and factors it's up to you to choose Android or iOS.

  

If you choose to have Android, then you're at right place, as said earlier back in time in the beginning era of smartphones and mobile operating systems, rooting Android smartphones used to be pretty simple, at that time there are many capable apps for mobiles and softwares for PCs, they used to root most Android smartphones in one click without unlocking bootloader that to in just few minutes thanks to that a lot of users almost all the time with just mobile app itself were able to easily root Android, though we do have desktop apps as well but they are less likely and rarely used by majority of Android users, whoever don't have PC and want more comfort at the same time don't want to put extra work in setting up and connecting Android with PC using proper USB cable and drivers, used to always prefer mobile root apps, anyway at the end though one click root apps are convenient but thing is most of them are closed source and the methods they used to root Android versions are not public due to that they are not trustworthy including that rooting softwares get direct system level write access which means any mess up in process or aftermath of rooting may soft or hard brick device which may only get fixed or recovered when you re-flash stock firmware, isn't that risky? Anyway as time goes in latest versions of Android OS security level increased immensely, due to that most one click rooting softwares have stopped support at the same time popular rooting software SuperSu got discontinued back in year 2016, so many Android users wanted new way better alternative rooting software, at that time we got systemless Android root software named Magisk.

  

[\+ What happened to Chainfire SuperSu?](https://www.techtracker.in/2022/09/what-happened-to-chainfire-supersu.html)

  

Magisk is revolutionary systemless Android rooting software developed by topjohnwu, thanks to it's systemless root method it got huge popularity and most Android users eventually shifted to Magisk and it became best alternative to Chainfire SuperSu, at present time Magisk is still on go choice for majority of Android users, unlike old one click root and SuperSU root based methods they used to enable direct system root access, that as said earlier is risky thing, while Magisk is systemless which means though it does get you root system level write access but it's achieved by patching firmware boot image after that Magisk create a overlay under your root partition and link it, due to that whatever root data will be in overlay, because of that when thing mess up and goes wrong, you don't have to hard reset device instead you just uninstall Magisk or it's modules via recovery or restore your stock firmware boot image, which in most cases will unbrick or solve issues of your Android device, that's why Magisk is considered as way better safe rooting software but like most softwares it has downsides as well, the main issue with Magisk is you must unlock device bootloader, and it patches stock firmware boot image including that it will also alter system root partition by storing Magisk data that arises SafetyNet issue, basically it makes your Android device fail in Google's basic integrity and CTS aka compatibility test suite profile match thus your Android device will be acknowledged as quite unsecure and untrustworthy due to that you can't run some secure apps, which can be fixed using modules like play integrity, playcurl, MagiskHideProps, SafetyNet etc but it's temporary fix including that Magisk is also not quite reliable in hiding root from device and apps, though there are few ways like MagiskHide, DenyList, Shamiko etc to fix, they do work but not accurately which is why many Android users wanted better and reliable alternative to Magisk, as there is demand to supply lately we got to see kernel based Android root softwares.

Kernel, is most important thing on smartphones, it's basically in simple words connect and work as bridge between your device hardware and software, without kernel you can't make things works on device, in sense kernel is quite sensitive thing that has to be handled with care else it may hard brick your device, which is why many developers suggest not to touch and play around with kernel and even if you do make sure to always backup device kernel, so that there will be chances of recovering bricked device, though messing up with kernel is like playing with fire, yet still for the improvement of device, many geeky developers explore kernel, tweaks kernel and also patch and make custom kernels,  mainly to upgrade or update operating system, improve performance, battery life and better compatibility with hardware and software etc, isn't that amazing? in recent years as said earlier kernel based Android solutions came up in this tech world, out of them the one I can recall is KernelSU, which basically patches Kernel to achieve root access on Android device because of that root won't be detected by device or apps and it will also pass basic integrity and CTS profile match. due to that you'll get better privacy, security and anonymity, which is why KernelSU considered as way better and more reliable rooting software than Magisk including that KernelSU also provide modules support thanks to that day by day KernelSU userbase growing immensely and it's widely considered as the best alternative to Magisk, but thing is though KernelSU is something that we can definitely rely upon yet still some people for whatever reasons want and search for way better alternative to KernelSU.

  

[\+ KernelSU - A kernel based Android root alternative to Magisk.](https://www.techtracker.in/2023/05/kernelsu-kernel-based-android-root.html)

  

Recently, after the success of KernelSU, many developers making their own kernel based root softwares for Android devices, out of them the one that picking up and became one of the best alternative to KernelSU is an free and open source  software named APatch that uses Kernel Patch as core and KernelSU for magisk module like support and app UI aka user interface, at present APatch only support ARM64 with Android kernel Version 3.18 - 6.1 devices, but we may in future also get

support for ARM7 and X86 devices as well with other Kernel versions, including that team also planned support for Samsung

devices, at the end APatch is basically a modified version of KernelSU so if you're someone who right on don't want to use KernelSU can go for APatch, including that there is APatch Lite developed by APatch developer Ponces, APatch Lite basically has Hardcoded superkey for simplicity with simplified UI dashboard and No KPM management, which didn't exist in orginal version of APatch, but thing is as superkey is hardcoded in APatch Lite it is not secure thus you have to use it quite carefully, so do you like it? Are you interested in APatch or APatch Lite? If yes then let's explore.
