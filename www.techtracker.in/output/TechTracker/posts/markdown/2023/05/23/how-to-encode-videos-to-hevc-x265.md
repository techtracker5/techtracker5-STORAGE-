</div><div><br></div><div>Who doesn't want to save space and network data on smartphones and PCs, usually a lot of people do isn't it? Unless they have big storage and data plan right? Majority of people especially in developing countries like india, bhutan, singapore and brazil etc, most likely not just buy low end mobiles and PCs which have limited space but also connect to limited network data plans with validity of one or few months, are you one of them? If so then you may probably download low quality data size and compressed files to save network data and regularly time to time delete old files to save storage on device right?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is bit hard and time taking process for sure isn't it? As though there are apps in PCs and smartphones which are able to automatically delete unused small and large files, but at the end sometimes you have to manually verify and delete them, so that important required files will not be lost as if they lost sometimes recovering them is bit difficult and even impossible isn't it? that makes sense we must always be careful when dealing with such stuff, but thing is sometimes you may don't want to delete any existing files at all yet still you may have to delete them forefully to free up device space for new files.</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, majority of people who have limited device storage space delete old files for new ones, thought we can use cloud hosting or streaming apps, but for that you need fast high data cap limit or unlimited data network, if you don't have them then it may be not possible for you to upload or stream most large size stuff online so in-order to save device storage you may like a lot of people around the world have to download or stream low quality files or compressed files and archives right? It will for sure definitely save device space and network data.</div><div><br></div><div>But, thing is not all files will be compressed and provided online even if you found required compressed files or achives online or offline, when you uncompress them they'll revert back to original size, so to store and manage them you need sufficient device space, it's&nbsp; possible you may think that if i have high data cap network then I can simply download large files and compress them&nbsp; to save space for new ones but thing is&nbsp; compression of files require high end PC or smartphone so only when you have them it'll work flawlessly, else you have to compromise and use low quality and less data size files which will work but may not give full-fledged usage or experience.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, there are large percentage of people who don't care much about quality of files when they are less in size but sometimes it is important and necessary to have full quality and size files else it can be issue and bit disappointing as well isn't it? There are a lot of people who care and want to have high quality full sizes files either it's videos, documents, images etc, are you one of them? If so are you unable to download and use high quality full sizes files due to limited device storage and network data? but still somehow want to download and use high quality full size files? then you're now at right place.</div><div><br></div><div>We are now going to say you how you can download and store high quality full size files even with limited storage space devices and data cap networks, As you may know each file is available in different formats like for instance when it comes to images, you'll find top formats, like png, jpeg, gif, tiff etc, so in the case of images when you make a high quality image in .png format it's size will be high but when you convert .png format image to .webp image format you'll have same image quality but with drastic reduction in file size thanks to it's lossy compression algorithm technology, so at the end even if you choose .webp over .png still visibility will be same and in addition you'll save device storage and data on the go.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, there are certain file formats similar to .webp, with them you'll get full&nbsp; quality data but at quite less size thanks to their algorithm technologies, since past few decades people around the world got used to digital file formats out of them digital images and videos are most used ones, in this context of article if we look into videos, there are many different video container formats like .mp4, .3gp, .mkv etc, each video container format has it's own pros and cons mainly they differ in size as well due to underlying algorithm technologies, isn't that fascinating?</div><div><br></div><div>In this digital era, thought we have different video container formats but if you care about video size then what matters most is how it is coded, since long time most videos are encoded in h.264 basically AVC aka advanced video coding format a quite popular video compression codec primarily used for bluray discs, but since past few decades it is being used in almost all video container formats, h.264 codec basically lowers the bitrate of video without reducing its quality, thought h.264 provide pretty good video compression but if you're tight on device storage space and data network then h.264 encoded videos may feel like large file size ones for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you know about h.264/AVC videos, have you used them? You may probably unknowingly got in touch with them as web is highly filled with them, if you're satisfied with it's video file size then it's fine but if you don't then you may probably already looking for an alternative right? If so then there is hevc aka high efficiency video coding h.265 codec that's basically replacement and evolution of h.264 with like 50% more video compression rate so that you'll get video files in half size with no reduction in visual quality due to that you can download even with limited data cap network and store them on quite low</div><div>storage space devices, fabulous right?<br></div><div><br></div><div>However, thought videos despite their container formats when encoded with hevc h.265 video codec, you'll find 50% reduction in size but the problem here is not all videos are available in .h265 codec and uploaded on web, so at the end if you want certain video with hevc .x265 codec then you have to encode it yourself using certain softwares like ffmpeg, but thing is encoding use a lot of RAM, so if you don't have high end PC or smartphone then it may take long time to encode and convert even small videos to hevc h.265, isn't that bit disappointing, It can be but don't worry recently we got to know about a simple&nbsp; method by using that you can encode any size video file to hevc .h265, excited?</div><div><br></div><div>Colab, have you ever heard of this? It's basically a platform provided by Google, Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, thanks to that some developers provided a Google Colab notebook script that you can use for free to encode videos uploaded on Google Drive to hevc .265, but wait are you thinking all this upload and convert stuff consume network data? don't worry Google Colab use it's cloud servers to encode videos including that we will be using telegram bot to upload our videos to Drive, so you only use network data when you want to download encoded videos on device from drive, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes then let's explore more.</div><div><br></div><div><b>• How to encode videos to hevc .265 codec using Google Colab •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
