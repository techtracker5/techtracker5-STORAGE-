</div><br></div><div>We have numerous VPN apps available for Android fortunately most of the VPNs&nbsp; are available for free yet some VPNs required daily, weekly, monthly, annual subscription or some free VPN apps put time limit for VPN usage until the user subscribe their paid VPN they won't remove time limit however, we even have some free VPNs which provide unlimited VPN access for free but the problem with these unlimited free access VPNs they put alot of ads which many users don't like.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Due to that people usually search for VPN app that don't have ads and give unlimited free VPN access without data cap or time limits but they end up with failure because we have very less VPN apps that don't put advertisements in their app even if they do not put ads most probably they put time limits or paid subscription based service which this section of users doesn't like to entertain such apps.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Yes, people want VPN apps without time limit, data cap and advertisements which is not easy to find because VPN apps are not easy to develop they need secured servers in multiple areas and countries due to that it requires alot of money that's why free VPN apps put ads or time limits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this scenario, we have a workaround to fix this issue, we found one VPN app that provide VPN service without ads or time limits and data cap from trusted company on Android which previously popular on PC but the only drawback of these VPN app was they don't provide multiple countries VPNs that we see in paid VPNs or free VPN's with ads but they give unlimited usage access to United States VPN which is popular choice among people who use VPN that to without time limit or data cap and paid subscriptions which is amazing.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>In search<b>,&nbsp;</b>of best free vpn from trusted source that provide service without ads, time limits &amp; data caps, we found Calyx VPN app available for android which is simple and easy to use app that have many extra features that will make this app one of the best free VPN app in 2021,<br></div><div><br></div><div>UltraSurf is well optimized to work on all devices but some features may not be ava- lable like you can't switch to different VPN countries that you get in paid VPN apps or free VPN apps with ads but you will get United States VPN with unlimited access and no limit or data cap which is amazing<br></div><div><br></div><div>Inshort, Calyx is a privacy focused secured free VPN app made by calyx institute who also made Calyx OS for people who take privacy very seriously to make world a better place, so calyx going to become popular very soon due to it's prospects like completely free service unlike other free VPN apps it doesn't have ads, or time limits and data caps which many people don't like, mainly it doesn't require login which is awesome.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>• Calyx VPN Official Support •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Website</b> : <b><a href="http://Calyx.net">Calyx.net</a></b></div><div><br></div><div><b>- App Info = </b><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.calyxinstitute.vpn/">FDroid</a><b>&nbsp;-</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>- How to download Calyx VPN •&nbsp;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>It is very easy to download Calyx VPN from these platforms for free.</div><div><br></div><div>- <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.calyxinstitute.vpn/">FDroid</a></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>• Calyx VPN key features with UI / UX Overview •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
