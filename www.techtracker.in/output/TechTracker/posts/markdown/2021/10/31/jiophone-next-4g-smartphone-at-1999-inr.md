</div><br></div><div>The actual pricing of JioPhone Next is 6,499 INR, but you will get it at 1,999 INR on first installment from then you have to only use Jio network &amp; recharge it on monthly basis with particular jio packages for 18 months or 24 months which means you are limited to using only Jio sim and indirectly you are paying full amount of 6,499rs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Jio Phone Next key features •</b></div><div><br></div><div>- Blue / Black</div><div>- 5.45” HD+ Screen with Multitouch</div><div>- 13 MP Rear / 8 MP Front [ Rear Flash ]</div><div>- 4G Enabled</div><div>- 3,500 mAh battery</div><div>- Qualcomm Snapdragon QM215</div><div>- 2GB RAM</div><div>- 32GB ROM</div><div>- Memory Card Support [ Upto 512GB ]</div><div>- Android 11, Pragati OS by Android</div><div>- Full Notch [ like old devices ]</div><div><br></div><div>- Buy Price : 1,999 = <a href="https://www.jio.com/jiophone-next/registration">Jio.com</a></div><div><br></div><div>Jio phone next specifications at the price of 1,999 is great but the restrictions like 18 to 24 months of Jio network usage is not satisfactory especially for a smartphone, unless you are committed to only use Jio network, even Jio Phone Next specs are not high enough to make people buy it in Instance as there are better alternatives at the price of 6,499 without any restrictions.</div><div><br></div><div>The main attraction of Jio Phone Next is Pragati OS which is made out of Android Go specially made for indian audience, if you keenly see pragati OS there is no big difference between pragati OS &amp; orginal android OS including that at the price of 6,499 you'll get Android Go OS which is made for low end devices that is totally not value for money, while at the price of 6,499 INR in market you will smartphones with competitive processor, storage, camera, software and many more.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, Jio phone next is only valuable when you are committed to only use Jio network for 18 to 24 months and if you only want use Google product, so if you have budget under 7K INR then I suggest you to find better smartphone as jio phone next even lag certain times including that you can't play big games in it.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, this is Jio phone next a android powered 4g smartphone at 1,999 via 1st installment made with partnership of Google so do you like it? do you own jio phone next? are you interested in Jio phone next?
