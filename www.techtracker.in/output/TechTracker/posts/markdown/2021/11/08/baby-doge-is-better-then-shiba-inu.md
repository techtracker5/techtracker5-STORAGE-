</div><br></div><div>Eventhough, Shiba Inu coin right now able to give high returns which is good fortune and definately beneficial for holders but Baby doge have tokenomics technology which means on every transaction occur within Baby doge, 10% will be taken as transaction fee on that 5% of baby doge will be in liquid pool and another 5% will be distributed to Baby doge holders, so in long run baby doge holders will get higher amount of baby doge in wallet and bigger profits in long run without even buying baby doge in future. Isn't amazing.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div>While, most crypto coins including Shiba inu do not have tokenomics, considering that Baby doge is better then Shiba inu, but the fact is future is unpredictable so anything can happen in future even Shiba Inu may add support for Tokenomics, in that scenario Shiba inu &amp; Baby doge may face tough competition as both are Elon Musk favourite coins which were inspired by Dogecoin.</div><div><br></div><div>But, The major problem faced by Baby doge coin is most crypto exchanges do not support Tokenomics which means it will take more time then usual to list Baby doge on crypto exchange platforms, Baby doge have to co-operate and ask the crypto exchange platforms to add support for Tokenomics which is new technology in crypto world.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
