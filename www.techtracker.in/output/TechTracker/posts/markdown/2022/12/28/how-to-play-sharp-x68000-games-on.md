</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I think if you're here then most probably you play games isn't it? Well as you may know there are two types of games which are general and digital ones, since ancient times people used to play general games around the world which are awesome but eventually thanks to latest advancements in technology we got electronic computers in which many Inventors Integrated digital technology and made digital games which are now widely played by people globally.</div><div><br></div><div>Electronic computers are basically hardware machine powered by electricity evolution of mechanical computers which in begginings used to be quite big and lack digital technology but eventually inventors from Machester University managed to run digital software developed using number of programming languages on processor of Machester baby computer since then companies for personal and commercial reasons started Integrating various types of softwares on electronic computers.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, we got digital technology on electronic computers but back then they used to be basic and big like in size of car including that they are super expensive so not everyone can afford them due to that electronic computers used to be limited in hands of millionaires, research scientists, governments, universities, companies like IBM etc but eventually many companies in order to expand reach created small size less expensive electronic computers that were named as home computers.</div><div><br></div><div>Digital games back then known as video games which are basically digital software with moving graphics and controls first created by inventor Steve Russell in year 1962 named Space War for electronic computers after that numerous inventors created their own computer games but the problem here is as said earlier electronic computers used to be big and expensive so most people unable to afford them to play video games, isn't that dissapointing?</div><div><br></div><div>However, when home computers entered in this world large percentage of people started accessing digital technologies and games since then people whoever can't or don't like or prefer to play general games started widely started playing digital video games available on home computer which over the years gone through many updates and upgrades due to that in 21st century we have modern home computers which can play powerful and advanced games.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, modern home computers which since long time also known as PCs aka personal computers are designed and capable enough to play heavy resources graphics intensive video digital games which are awesome so majority of people choose to play them but some people for nostalgia or out of curiosity reasons still like and prefer to play old PC digital video games, are you one of them?</div><div><br></div><div>There are two types of home computers, normal and gaming centric, in normal home computers you can run regular softwares and digital video games as well but in gaming centric home computers you can only play digital games which are like arcade and home video game console, at the end if you have any device you can play games on them isn't that cool?</div><div><br></div><div>The only few differences is on home computer you have to play digital video games using keyboard and when it comes to arcade and home video game machines you have to play with joystick which is way better and easy to use then keyboard but it's user specific some like to use keyboard and other joystick, anyway now majority&nbsp; people play digital video games on home computers also known as PCs isn't it?</div><div><br></div><div>But, if you're someone who want to play old home computer video games then it's super hard unless you already it and running fine as makers stopped selling them long time ago so it's not possible to get new ones yet if you strongly decided to play them then you have to buy old home computers from certain offline or online stores where availability is not guaranteed even if you found the one as it's rare you will get it at expensive price for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>In case, you are collector and trying to preserve old technologies for personal or museum showcase purposes then buying old home computer is totally worth but if you are common person just want to buy old home computer to play old digital video games then it's not worth as now you can play them on any modern PCs and smartphones using emulator softwares.</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, most emulator softwares are considered unofficial as they're developed by third party developers who are not associated with makers of home computers due to that third party developers have to do and go through everything manually in making emulator softwares which is hard that's why most unofficial emulators stay in early access, alpha or beta phase for long time.</div><div><br></div><div>It is not possible to directly play few decades back home computer digital videos games on current modern electronic devices like PCs and smartphones due to hardware and software differences which is why emulator softwares are developed in compatible digital format using supported programming languages due to that you'll be able to play home digital video games on modern PCs and smartphones etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Third party developers emulate hardware and software of home computer in digital softwares due to that you basically get virtual environment inside software digitally where you can sideload home computer digital video games which is like virtual box, operating system and nutshell but the thing is doing this process is not difficult which is one of the main reason why most un-official emulators take quite long time to become stable ones.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, unofficial emulators will have more bugs and issues while using software or playing digital video games which third party developers have to debug on their own or as per reports of users to find and fix them which is not easy and takes time that's the reason why stable versions are released late but from past few years to speed up development of unofficial emulators many third party developers releasing their unofficial emulators as free and open source on platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc.</div><div><br></div><div>GitHub and GitLab are contributive development platforms where third party developers publish their unofficial emulator source code as public repositores so anyone from web can commit their code to improve unofficial emulators by adding options and features or fixing bugs etc due to that now a days unofficial emulators at much faster rate becoming stable, isn't that amazing?</div><div><br></div><div>FOSS aka free and open source unofficial emulators are much better then closed ones as the source code is public you can check and verify it's authenticity for safety if everything is fine then you can use it securely but when it comes to closed source unofficial emulators you won't know if developer of it hide any malicious code which is harmful that's why if you&nbsp; care about privacy then it's better to go with open source unofficial emulators.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, the another benefit of open source unofficial emulators is as the source code is public anyone can use it to make their own custom version of unofficial emulator adding their own touch ups to upgrade and degrade it due to that now we have many unofficial emulator clients and ports of PCs to smartphones and vice versa which are not just useful but also surely increase productivity.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, usually PCs support more unofficial emulators then smartphones as PCs comes with way more powerful hardware and advanced software due to that large percentage of third party developers focus on making unofficial emulators for PCs but from last one decade mainly from past past few years they're targeting smartphones as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Smartphones are now widely used by almost all people more then PCs as they are handheld devices which are evolution of telephones and PDAs that has operating system which can do almost all tasks of PC that's why it has huge demand so to supply companies continous upgrading smartphones due to that third party developers started making and porting many existing or new unofficial emulators for smartphones so they may definitely work in future.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, if you want to play classic old home computer digital video games as they are old and basic due to that third party developers already created and released numerous stable unofficial emulators with many options and features for smartphones thus you can play quite them quite conveniently and comfortably with high FPS efficiently on the go.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we found an free and open source no ads unofficial emulator cross platform software with support for Android powered smartphones named RetroArch which has Sharp X68000 home computer digital video games&nbsp;that you have to download and use to start playing effectively, so do you like it? are you interested?
