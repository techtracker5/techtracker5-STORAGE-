</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Now a days, we frequently use internet to know any type of information but have you ever thought what exactly is internet? It is created by ARPANET back in year 1969 is an standard protocol build for electric and electronic computers to move data on an network which provide unique IP address to each computer for identity at first IP is primarily used to send messages between two computers after that it gone through alot of improvements and updates due to that the usages of IP extended but as it's private require manual access everytime.</div><div><br></div><div>There are three types of computers, founder Charles Babbage in early 18th century created hardware based mechanical parts machine without electricity but in mid 19th century inventors and companies build electric and electronic computers then upgraded them to integrate operating system basically software that can install more softwares which are developed using various programming languages after that in 20th century we got keypad mobile phones and smartphones that can also install softwares and do almost all real life physical action tasks electronically and digitally same as computers.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Anyhow, fortunately In year 1991 Tim Berners Lee created and released an revolutionary software named WWW aka world wide web browser that can access public contents of internet which are in digital form accessible on computers due to that it recieved huge attention and recognition from people around the world who created various useful digital platforms in form of websites and blogs on thier computer and created an server using RAM aka system memory to host them on Internet.</div><div><br></div><div>However, computers back in Web 1.0 are not powerful enough they have basic hardware and software that was only capable to create and store less size digital platforms even RAM also only able to handle few hundred visitors due to that companies to supply demand of users for personal or commercial reasons by web 2.0 era started in early 20th century begin selling poweful computers so alot of people created big size modern digital platforms using various programming languages but they are quite expensive so not everyone can afford them.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, since the beginning of internet many developers and companies created cloud hosting platforms which in back end use hardware to provide the storage and ram but you can't see them instead you will get them in digital form with flexible plans and plenty of options and features where you have to register with details for verification and login purposes then setup to host all your websites and blogs.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, cloud hosting platforms are way more convenient and comfortable to host digital platforms then computers as they can be accessible on any supported electronic device like computer but the problem here is they rely on centralized servers as they use only single server to protect private credentials and data of digital platforms due to that black hat hackers primarly target and exploit them via loop holes to gain access and delete or extract personal data for illegal means like publishing online or selling on darkweb etc which is why we're upgrading to Web 3.0.</div><div><br></div><div>Web3.0 is future of internet where digital platforms use many decentralized servers known as nodes provided by company or individuals around the world thus they are not only censorship resistant and stay always uptime but also provide military grade security thus it's near to impossible for anyone to hack them including that Web3 is also about decentralization of all types of digital softwares.</div><div><br></div><div>On January 3, 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto an anonymous person may be inspired by Web3 concept created and released decentralized digital crypto currency that provide privacy using crypto wallet where you don't have to submit any personal details and security with it's proof of stake system where miners using computer power solve crypto algorithm blocks to authenticate and verify transactions thus it's fraud proof and then transparency using Blockchain explorer where crypto wallet total value and transactions shown in real time publicly, amazing isn't?</div><div><br></div><div>Bitcoin is revolutionary crypto currency at first Satoshi Nakamoto want organic growth so didn't done any advertising and promotions but later on with in few years Bitcoin gained alot of loyal and new investors with fame globally due to that it eventually become world's most popular and valuable crypto currency after that many developers and companies created thier own crypto currency using different technologies similar to Bitcoin but with new features by adapting to latest crypto technologies accordingly like Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, Kusuma, Polkodot etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Now we have numerous crypto currencies with millions of tokens known as non fungible token which rely on network chain of particular open source crypto currency and they are rapidly progressing by extensively using Web3 decentralized concept for Instance from past few years many developers and companies created and integrated dApps aka decentralized apps into crypto currency wallets by using them manage crypto currency assets efficiently and do more then before.</div><div><br></div><div>But, majority of people don't know about Web3 as it's not available in full scale even if they want to know or already have knowledge on Web3 crypto currencies still most of them didn't joined any Web3 crypto communities available on social media networks even if they joined yet most probably almost all of them only discuss about particular crypto currency not all Web3 crypto currencies including that they don't provide any rewards thus the interest to stay active and help others without any profit is quite boring isn't?</div><div><br></div><div>In case, you don't know about social media networks which are basically digital platforms available as websites and softwares for computers and smartphones etc at first in beginnings social media networks are basic in CLI aka command line interface and TUI aka text based interface that are not easy to use unless you're programmer but after the entry of world wide web we started getting user friendly GUI aka graphical user Interface poweful and advanced modern social media networks which provide amazing features using various latest technologies.</div><div><br></div><div>In 21st century, we have modern social media networks on them you can send unlimited digital messages and files, make live audio and video calls to individuals or groups, create channels to broadcast content and groups with alot of members to chat with community where you can not only chat but also share digital stuff and get likes or comments etc which is now global advanced way of communication widely used by people conveniently.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we found an app named ROLA.ai which is an AI aka articifical intelligence based Web3 crypto currency social media networks for Web3 crypto enthusiasts and supporters where you can do crypto currency predictions and get crypto rewards including that it creates personal NFT using sentinel analysis with Social-fi and games as bonus for joyful community, so do you like it? are you interested in ROLA.ai?
