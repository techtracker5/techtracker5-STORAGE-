</div><div><br></div><div>When for the first time in year 1946 Manchester baby computer run digital software on it's processor at that time it was not in visible format without monitor but later many inventors and companies integrated monitor display into computer either electric or electronic ones with CLI aka command line interface and GUI aka operating systems basically softwares.</div><div><br></div><div>Computer softwares are developed using numerous programming languages by programmers to execute various tasks electronically and digitally at first they were used to send digital messages between computers using IP aka internet protocol after that alot of inventors and companies created numerous categories digital softwares for different purposes even for playing games.</div><div><br></div><div>In this world, people play number of real indoor and outdoor games mainly for fun, enjoyment and relaxation etc what if you can play games on computers it will be revolutionary and amazing isn't? back in year 1962 Steve Russell of MIT and his team developed and released world's first digital moving graphic video game named SpaceWar! to run that computer used to be in size of car, fascinating isn't?</div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, after SpaceWar! many developers individually or along with companies created better quality moving graphics digital video games for computer due to that list increased for sure but the reach of them limited to only few people as computers are not home compatible and very expensive as well which is why most people unable to afford them even they can still it's difficult to arrange huge free size to fit computers in homes.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, computers are mostly available in big companies like IBM or with some millionaires and billionaires but large percentage of common people have interest to play computer digital video games exists as there is no choice they used to wonder and restrict themselves due to huge size and super expensive price of digital computers.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, after decade in year 1971 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in order full fill wish to play computer digital video games at price that can almost every can afford for people considering demand and commercial aspects under Syzygy engineering company they developed and released world's first arcade video game machine named ComputerSpace designed for offline stores and gaming centres etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Computer Space though expensive and not home compatible but it is fully gaming centric machine with pay and use system where anyone can drop few pennies to get certain amount of play time set by owner due to that alot of people mainly teens and kids were able to afford and play computer digital video games for the first time but ComputerSpace failed commercially.</div><div><br></div><div>However, many inventors and companies around the world using the template and several other technologies build thier own hardware and software arcade video game machines with numerous advancements&nbsp; adapting to new technologies accordingly&nbsp; in that process eventually in few years we got modern arcade video game machines which recieved huge wide attention and recognition around the world.</div><div><br></div><div>The main reason behind the popularity and immense success of arcade video game machines is because of it's pay and use system that not only let people get in touch with computer digital video games at affordable prices and simultaneously also provide revenue generating model and facility to it's owners to make income that's cool and amazing right?</div><div><br></div><div>But, there are some drawbacks of arcade video game machines that certain percentage of people don't like which limiting it's reach to full scale to name few foremost they are not one time purchase and every time when you want to play arcade machine video games you need to visit offline stores wherever it's available which is not always possible mainly to busy schedule persons for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, if you have enough free home space and money to fit and maintain arcade video game machines then it's fine but not everyone can for them in year 1972 Magnavox developed and released small home video game console which you can connect to television then start playing fantastic digital video games back in time at your convenience comfortably.</div><div><br></div><div>Home video game consoles are one time purchase and can be used anywhere and anytime which is why majority of arcade video game machine users eventually shifted to home video game consoles due to that demand increased exponentially and in order to supply many companies globally competing with each other in this capitalist world started making numerous cool home video game consoles.</div><div><br></div><div>Companies leveled up home video game consoles with alot of advancements and enhancements to update and upgrade in that process we got modern home video game consoles which are integrated with super powerful hardware and advanced software equipped with big storage and memory which are designed to play huge size heavy resources high definition and resolution graphics home console video games smoothly with high fps rate.</div><div><br></div><div>Now a days, most people around the world use modern home video game consoles on them in extension you can use mixed reality technology handsets to get real life immersive gaming experience but some people out of curiosity or mainly due to nostalgia reasons want to play old home console video games which are right now unavailable as long time ago companies stopping making and selling them.</div><div><br></div><div>You may not get new old home video game consoles but we have few offline and online stores where you can buy some old home console video games which are expensive as they are rare so it's better to only buy them if you're collector and trying to preserve old technologies else they are not worthy instead you can play almost all nostalgia old home console video games through emulator softwares available on personal computers and smarphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Majority of emulators are developed by third party developers thus they are considered unofficial as personal computers and smartphones can't directly Install and run old home console video games due to numerous hardware and software differences which is why third party developers make unofficial emulator in supported digital format using various compatible programming languages then implement and emulate old home video game console hardware integrating on software of unofficial emulators.</div><div><br></div><div>Unofficial emulators provide an inside hardware environment of home video game console digitally in its software where you can sideload and run games for example : operating system and Virtual Box and Nutshell etc but emulating hardware of home video game console is hard and takes time which is why majority of home video game consoles stay in early access or alpha phase.</div><div><br></div><div>Third party developers of unofficial emulators are most likely not associated with official makers of home video game consoles thus they won't get any kind of help or support due to that they have to create and implement everything from scratch then debug and test manually or get bug reports from users when they are using software or while playing home console video games which is lengthy process so it takes long time.</div><div><br></div><div>In order to escalate developement of unofficial emulators from past one decade alot ot third party developers releasing it's code as free and open source project via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc where anyone though web can commit thier code to update and upgrade softwares with optimizations and bug fixes etc due to that unofficial emulators are going to stable phase quickly.</div><div><br></div><div>The another main prospect of being free and open source unofficial emulator project is anyone can use it's code to make thier own custom version of unofficial emulator to improve or enhance etc due to that you can get unofficial emulators clients of personal computers get ported to smartphones and vice versa to get more awesomeness.</div><div><br></div><div>In case of personal computers they support more unofficial emulators then smartphones because of it's powerful hardware and software which can manage and run home console video games more efficiently that's why third party developers also give first priority to make unofficial emulators for personal computers but as there is demand they're working constantly to release latest new personal computers unofficial emulators softwares port to latest smartphones as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Smartphones came in replacement of keypad mobile phones which can do almost all tasks of personal computers but don't of support of many modern home video game console emulator due to incapable hardware and software but as companies rapidly upgrading smartphones they will support any unavailable unofficial</div><div>emulator softwares in future.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, In case of Campcom Systems 1, 2, 3&nbsp; home console video games they are quite old and basic due to that third party developers already build many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as they are capable enough to play any old classic Campcom Systems home console video games pretty well.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we found an no ads free and open source unofficial emulator cross platform software with with support for Android powered smartphones named RetroArch based on front end of Liberto&nbsp; which has Capcom System 1, 2, 3 home consolevideo games cores that you have to download to start playing for free.</div><div><br></div><div>Note : Retroarch emulator require BIOS aka basic input and out system program file to start home video game console system of CPS 1, 2, 3 without that you can't play home console video games but don't worry we will provide them below which you have to run it first else nothing going to work gotcha? so do you like it? are you interested in RetroArch unofficial emulator? If yes let's explore more.</div><div><br></div><div><div><div><b>• RetroArch official support •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>-&nbsp;<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">Facebook</a></div><div>-&nbsp;<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">YouTube</a></div><div>-&nbsp;<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">Twitter</a></div><div>-&nbsp;<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">GitHub</a></div><div>-&nbsp;<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">Instagram</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>Website :&nbsp;</b><a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">retroarch.com</a></div><div><b>Email :&nbsp;</b><a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">libretro@gmail.com</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>• How to download RetroArch •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>-&nbsp;<a data-original-attrs="{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/576144228092907456#&quot;}" href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8984889699081605598/6033294784871741006#">official</a>&nbsp;</div></div><div>- CPS [ BIOS ] { soon }</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>• How to play CPS 1, 2, 3 video games on Android using RetroArch with key features and UI / UX Overview •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><div class="separator"><div class="separator" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
