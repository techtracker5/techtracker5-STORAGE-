You can rank website with custom domain and if you remove it later as a backup you'll have blogspot.com for AdSense validity.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons &gt;</div><div><br></div><div>1. Lack of development from google and it has no updates so far recently released a mobile version of website view other than no added features.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Lack of templates, you can do customized of your own.. No big templates availability from developers but there are some amazing contenders who strive to provide templates and do have amazing templates for website to make professional.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Lack of plugin as it will be more useful for static websites and bloggers, not for heavy resource things won't work as it doesn't support.</div><div><br></div><div>4. As it only support xml no other format are supported as of now</div><div><br></div><div>5.

WordPress server optimization was not top notch you have add cloudflare for better speed.</div><div><br></div><div>4. If you have a custom domain you must have to use a third party hosting provider else buy premium VIP service, this was a pros and con for different users.</div><div><br></div><div>5. WordPress doesn't have spam comment system automatically, you have to install plugin for most of things that you wanna do including activating SSL.</div><div><br></div><div>6. If you got any problem on something or you are not aware of something done some mistake you could possibly loose more, you have to completely understand WordPress environment and backup most priority.</div><div><br></div><div>7. Not a easy usable and understanding and you have to keep on updating things etc. Like plugins fix errors and you get more work on website itself rather than content [ user - specific ]</div><div><br></div><div>WordPress is a great competitor for blogger it has reached more users than any platform and it is considered as priority for most of the users for advanced features, its best for resource required websites and techy websites or to use own plugins you can find plugins for most of everthing ot can be used for almost all sites etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion : Both of them have pros and cons choose according to your requirement before doing something think wise and take decision as both are different things in different ways.</div><div><br></div><div>Keep Supporting : TechTracker.in</div></div>
