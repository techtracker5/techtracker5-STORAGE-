</div><br></div><div>Overall, this site-map user interface is pretty impressive with default white background, which also highlight latest posts with " New " text and all posts were fitted well in vertical blocks, it is simple, easy to use and provides fast smoother user experience without lags or issues, including that you can edit or tweak the sitemap if you know little coding.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Moreover, it is worth to mention the above provided Sitemap will only work on Google blogger platform, don't waste your time by adding it on wordpress, it will not work and I believe for wordpress there are plugins or some other way to add a Sitemap like this, do some research before doing any thing.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, this is modern site-map which you can add on your blogger page, are you an existing user of this site-map?
