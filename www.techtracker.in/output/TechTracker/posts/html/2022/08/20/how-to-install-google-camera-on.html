</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Camera, is a revolutionary hardware device at first it was used to capture and record real life objects known as photographs in black and white mode then save them on negetive reels but later on thanks to Inventors who developed camera further due to them we got color mode cameras yet they used to rely on negetive reels so in order view photographs we have to manually go through photo processing&nbsp; that require additional equipments.</div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, In year 1975 Steven Saason invented digital camera that can store photographs as digital files known as images and films as videos on SRAM or DRAM since then camera companies around the world started making thier own versions of digital cameras using and adapting to various new technologies to improve and add new features due to that we got advanced digital cameras.</div><div><br></div><div>Digital cameras over the years gone through rapid advancements due to that in 21st century we have small and modern DSLR digital cameras which can right now capture 8K high resolution images and videos then save them on HDDs aka hard drives or SDDs aka static state drives based on storage capacity after that you can view images and videos on attached display monitor or supported electronic devices with compatible softwares.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>There is huge demand for modern digital cameras around the world as they're not just easy to use but also professional so companies for personal or commercial reasons started integrating almost all modern digital cameraa latest hardware and software technologies on many other&nbsp;</div><div>electronic devices like PCs aka personal computers, mobile and smartphones etc.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Even though, at first digital camera resolution on PCs, mobiles and smartphones is very low like 0.3mp and 1mp etc but later on because of continous developements from mobile companies digital cameras of smartphones are now competing with many DSLR cameras in terms of resolution and features etc.</div><div><br></div><div>However, DSLR digital cameras may capture better image quality than that of smartphones as DSLR digital cameras are specifically developed and designed using powerful technologies to simply capture high resolution images and videos in any scenarios even in low lightning condition environments so they are widely used in movies, events, tourism, photography and other important or expensive projects.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div>Anyhow, now Sony a popular and well known top digital camera company is continuously implementing almost all of it's technologies on Sony smartphones to improve resolution and make them reach the level of DSLR digital cameras thus on Sony smartphones you'll get best camera quality after that Apple inc. new iPhone smartphones known to capture quality high resolution images and videos par to Sony flagship smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>The quality of images captured through digital camera is not just depeneded on hardware but also on software as it will process the image to provide well refined quality image output which is why even if you have high mega pixel digital camera it may sometimes or everytime struggle to compete with less mega pixel camera as here that camera is probably using better quality mega pixels or using an advanced software to process and generate high quality resolution images and videos.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, software plays main role on digital cameras to get quality output as software in processing phase remove noise then tune images and videos to its best for quality shot that's why alot of camera and smartphones makers are from long time simultaneously focusing on both digital cameras hardware and it's software to improve quality of images and videos but some companies don't focus on software instead they rely on hardware which may also work but it's always better to focus on both hardware and software on digital cameras for best results.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, Google a popular search engine giant founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in year 1996 buyed an operating system named Android from Andy Rubens in year 2005 for $50 millon after that they partnered with Taiwanese mobile maker HTC and released world's first Android powered smartphone on September 23, 2008 named HTC Dream G1 to compete with Apple inc. iPhones.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, after HTC Dream Google partnered with many other mobile companies like Samsung, LG, Motorola etc to release more Android OS smartphones and as Google smartly released Android as free and open source project anyone can use it so mobile companies around tbe world in just few years used Android extensively to ship thier own Android powered smartphones globally.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, Android smartphones has more then 70% worldwide market share and give edge to edge competition with iPhone on almost all segments but in terms of digital camera quality Android smartphones except Sony are behind iPhone because Apple inc. use costly quality cameras and do alot of software optimizations to scale up image and video quality of new iPhone model smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Google known to do mavellous magics with software technologies so in order to fix low camera quality issue on&nbsp; Android powered smartphones released Google Camera on April 16, 2014 that drastically improve images and videos quality using many Google's software algorithms but later for some reasons Google stopping upgrading it's Google camera and made it as closed source OEM app on Google Pixel smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Google Camera is amazing app that depends mainly on software to generate greater quality images and videos even if hardware is mediocre because of that it received millons of users but unfortunately after Google ends support they have no choice other then to use alternative better camera apps like stock or Open Camera.</div><div><br></div><div>Luckily, A developer named <a href="http://">BSG</a> in year 2018 using many tricks and methods managed to port Google's Pixel exclusive Google Camera to Snapdragon Qualcomm 800+ processor smartphone after that many third party developers gradually started porting Google Camera to other Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, 600, 700 series smarphones which are officially not supported by Google Camera.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
