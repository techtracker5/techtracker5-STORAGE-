</div><br></div><div>Even though, most people limited themselves to watching films via cassettes and DVDs or cable TV channels but alot of people still like to go theatres due to various reasons mainly because of it's big screen and films usually release first day on theatres and then after few months comes to cassettes and DVDs then later on cable TV channels.</div><div><br></div><div>However, when we got revolutionary PC aka personal computers entered in this world in year 1970s it become best alternative and replacement to cassettes and DVDs players as it with or without cassettes and DVDs can play films that are converted into digital video formats like .mpeg4 aka .mp4 and .matroska aka .mkv etc using video player softwares according to hardware support and compatibility.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div>Usually, most people don't mind in getting access to piracy prints of films from offline stores if they want to watch it in first day or weeks of its release but some people like and prefer to legally watch films who may have to buy tickets and go theatres or wait until films officially get released on cassettes and DVDs or cable TV channels that takes time based on the film commercial success world wide.</div><div><br></div><div>In year 1991, Tim Berners Lee created an browser software named WWW aka world wide web that can access public contents of Internet protocol on computers due to that people around the world created and hosted numerous revolutionary digital platforms using various programming languages in format of websites and blogs that expanded the accessibility of films on computers through digital cassette or DVD rips etc isn't amazing and fascinating?.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, In year 2005 a revolutionary video streaming website named YouTube released on world wide web of internet that allows anyone to upload and watch video together where companies can publish films but they usually won't do for commercial reasons even if they do it will be after few months or years due to that large percentage of people diverted to piracy websites to watch films as soon as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, the arrival of OTT digital platforms started in early 20th century which are basically in form of websites or softwares for personal computers and computers created by company with movies and web series that you can select and watch legally without advertisements&nbsp; after paying for subscription plans or with advertisements watch completely for free.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>OTT digital streaming platforms companies self produce or legally acquire copyrights of films or web series etc&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>by bidding or direct buying them from producers which is similar to acquiring copyrights of films or web series etc to telecast on Television cable or DTH networks but limited to world wide web of internet that's very useful for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, we have modern DTH networks evolved version of cable TV networks with alot of features and options where you can mainly subscribe TV channels as many you like in available ones with each one having its own price and watch 24/7 hours but still most people prefer and like to use OTT digital streaming platforms.</div><div><br></div><div>The main advantage and speciality of OTT digital streaming platforms is over there latest films or you can say movies or cinemas in modern times released in first day or in few weeks or months including that you'll get web series and many more which all you can watch anywhere and anytime on PCs and smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, you won't find most latest films released first day on OTTs mainly big ones but some do which is why OTTs may right now can't replace theatres but in future if producers and companies release thier films first day in OTTs then hopefully one day OTTs will definitely replace theatres that's very like possible in future.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, now a days we have many OTTs as almost all media companies created thier own one seeing the demand and commercial success of other OTT websites and apps but actually a decade have we have very few OTTs due to lack of awareness and no demand from people as they mostly used to focus on TV.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
