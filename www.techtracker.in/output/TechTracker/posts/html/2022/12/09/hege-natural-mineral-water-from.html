</div><br><p></p><p dir="ltr">However, majority of people are not aware and don't use normal or activated charcoal water purification methods instead use RV and RO technologies but as said earlier it removes minerals to big extent, if you're someone who want pure water with minerals at safe WHO standard levels but don't want RO and RV processed water from local metropolitan water supply quality or anywhere else then you have to get natural water directly from start of natural rivers surrounded by mountains or springs where you'll get best quality pure drinkable natural mineral water which are good and improve health effectively.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not possible for most people in this world to get natural mineral spring water from the beggining of rivers surrounded by mountains or anything else as 90% percentage of people don't leave near to them like in in metropolitan urban or suburban localities even in rural areas as well even if you live still you may need skills or certain equipments to get best quality water which not everyone can do that process isn't it? but many people like and prefer to drink them everyday.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br><p></p><p dir="ltr">We have numerous brands in india who sell himalayas natural spring water out of them Hege brand seems super value for money then other companies as their way of explanation and process of getting natural mineral water from Himalayas are not just interesting but also spectacular which will amaze you but before getting into more details about Hege let's first know why the prices of natural mineral spring water is high then regular water which you get at low prices easily.</p><p dir="ltr">Generally, natural spring water is untouched by humans and processed directly from natural rivers surrounded by mountains or anything else including that they are not processed through reverse osmosis so you'll get high amount of quality and pure minerals and alkaline level which is good for health including that as companies process them near to mountains from areas it is hard to not just make but also transport which is hard and take more time than regular water that's why natural spring mineral water is 50% even more costly then regular water but if you can afford then they are worthy.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br><p></p><p dir="ltr">In our opinion, natural mineral water of Hege as it's from Himalayas is good and we even seen white mineral deposits which confirm that it's natural mineral water as you normally won't get them in regular water but the price though less then other brands at INR 900 which you can get for INR 450 for first time users using TRYME50 coupon code with flexible subscription options and cash on delivery but still it's bit expensive considering in indian market as most people in india don't buy natural spring water, if they want to get more customers then we believe that it's better if they decrease price bit further other then that rest is awesome.</p><div><br></div><div><b>• Hege official support •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naturalhege">Facebook</a></div><div>- <a href="https://twitter.com/HegeNatural?t=WTGVVxI2v1DoiXUV-tvE5g&amp;s=09">Twitter</a></div><div>- <a href="https://youtube.com/@naturalhege7801">YouTube</a></div><div>- <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naturalhege/">Instagram</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>Phone : </b><i style="font-weight: bold;">75699 11111</i></div><div><b>Email : </b>​<a href="http://Info@naturalhege.com">Info@naturalhege.com</a></div><div><b>Website : </b><a href="http://naturalhege.com">naturalhege.com</a></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>• How to buy Hege Himalayas natural mineral water •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
