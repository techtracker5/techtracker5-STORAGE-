</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>South Korea, when you think about this country which electronic companies you get in mind? majority of people says out of top 5 there will be Samsung isn't it? A well known and most popular company which is now one of the biggest conglomerate that manufacture and sell various different electronic products out of them one of the main ones are electronic smartphones.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Eventhough, Samsung also sells keypad mobile phones but currently majority of people like and prefer to own smartphones as they comes with powerful hardware and software which are capable to execute almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally which is why Samsung since long time like for more then decade making and selling modern smartphones worldwide.</div><div><br></div><div>Smartphones are basically made up of electronic hardware but Integrated with digital softwares to extend it's capabilities, a decade back when first smartphone was released by Apple inc. it used to have iOS a closed source operating system or you can say software thus samsung can't use it at that time Google released amazing open source software named Android for smartphones so Samsung started using it on their smartphones extensively.</div><div><br></div><div>Eventhough, now most smartphones from Samsung either it's low, mid and flagship range are powered by Android due to personal and mainly because of commercial reasons but Samsung does have it own operating system specifically designed and developed by them named Tizen which Samsung primarly use on Galaxy Z smartphones and smart TVs.</div><div><br></div><div>Samsung Tizen OS though open source like Android and widely used on most Samsung Smart TVs which is even used on many other companies but when it comes to smartphones Samsung limited it's Tizen OS to Galaxy Z series that I think&nbsp; is test to see how people recieve Tizen OS which is not available in full scale as most people don't like and prefer Tizen OS.</div><div><br></div><div>Tizen OS is basically linux based software like Android but it's failed one atleast when it comes to smartphones as most people and companies don't use them which is though foss aka free and open source but Samsung based on their marketing plans and strategies modified it to make it way more secure on Galaxy Z series due to that you can't install external apps and do stuff like on Android, isn't that dissapointing?</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, the incapability of Tizen OS to install external Android apps is big - to it that's one of the major point which leaded Tizen OS to failure as most people like and prefer Android they used don't care much about Tizen OS but some people who don't know know much about technology used to buy Tizen OS smartphones and then in just few days or weeks definitely regret buying it, are you one of them?</div><div><br></div><div>Here's why, when you buy any smartphone then it's operating system must have enough apps basically always executable softwares isn't it? then only you are able to enjoy apps and stay upto date in modern times right? but when it comes to Tizen OS on Samsung Galaxy Z series it has very less apps even well known and popular ones are unavailable as most developers are now focused on Android and iOS.</div><div><br></div><div>If you're someone who already have an Samsung Galaxy Z series then their is no Google Play and you can't directly install third party Android apps from world wide web, the only way you can install apps is from Samsung app store but there are few methods which can indirectly install third party apps on Galaxy Z smartphones but most of them won't work effectively.</div><div><br></div><div>The methods which let you install Android apps on Tizen OS based Samsung Galaxy Z series smartphones don't need to unlock bootloader or root device but some methods need them which voids device warranty but even if you apply methods still as they are not reliable and won't work 100% which is why you may have seen number of&nbsp; people complaining regarding them on social platforms like YouTube.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, whatever methods that we have to install Android apps on Samsung Galaxy Z series though they are bit lengthy process yet considering it's usefulness even layman can do them taking some time but the problem here is those methods don't work on all Samsung Galaxy Z series smartphones, only some of them will work that to can't guarantee it's working time, isn't that dissapointing?</div><div><br></div><div>In case, you are someone who already have Samsung Galaxy Z smartphone and somehow managed to install Android apps on Tizen OS then it's fine but if you want to buy Samsung Galaxy Z smartphones may be you're a fanboy or due to low budget as it's low end devices but want apps like on Android then wait in one our opinion it's better to don't go with it as right now there are many better awesome smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>However, if you have Tizen OS based Samsung Smart TV then it's fine as most people use only streaming apps and Tizen OS as said earlier is one of the best software for smart TV's but if you are someone who want to install a lot of Android apps on smart TV just like you do on smartphones and Android smart TVs&nbsp; then Tizen OS is not right choice.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, it doesn't mean Tizen OS based Galaxy Z smartphones has no value just because it has limited apps, Tizen OS does have it's own some pros which is pretty useful for those who are not familiar or don't want Android apps instead require simple and low end price smartphones to make calls and messages with some apps for fun then Galaxy Z series smartphones may work for them for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, Samsung specifically developed Tizen OS exclusively for Galaxy Z smartphones, it's custom software made in a way to differ from Android so you'll get bit different UI and UX but similar one so if you want one open source new operating system based on smartphones other then Android then you may check it out Tizen OS based Galaxy Z smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, if for whatever reasons you thinking about buying a Tizen OS based Samsung Galaxy Z series smartphones then we personally suggest you to don't buy it but to be more clear we provide you some of its key advantages and disadvantages right below so you can decide on your own, so do you like it?
