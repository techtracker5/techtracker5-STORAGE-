</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Home or office anywhere you go, when you decided to have privacy you must get it isn't it? everyone wants privacy and now in this modern world thanks to democracy and privacy respecting governments over long time as per demand of people most countries judicial authorities developed and framed various different laws even amended in constitution to completely protect personal privacy of it's citizens in their potential and capability using legal law enforcements to ensure and maintain security and harmony of their people and country to stay and be in safe zone.</div><div><br></div><div>Since ancient times there are always certain percentage of people due to psychological mentality of humans they like and prefer to know someone else private affairs and activities etc out of one or numerous various different reasons or emotions or situations and emotions due to that in every country around the world someone get surveillanced or stalked by common people illegally or legally by law enforcement agencies because of that they totally end up losing privacy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Even though, surveillance by legal law enforcements is legal which is usually conducted with or without consent and knowingly or unknowingly by someone to protect him or someone else even country according to laws ethically yet still not everyone liked to get watched by anyone even if they are criminals and doing wrong things locally or internationally in order to protect personal space and privacy which is why they use numerous methods to re-gain it like manipulating or smartly using legal laws or get rid of surveillance using bad procedures and actions illegally.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, common people who didn't violated laws usually not surveillanced by law enforcement agencies but as said earlier they are certain percentage of people who illegally spy on someone or something for good or evil personal or commercial benefits using their own or publicly known tricks mainly via physical hiding or using spy technologies which is why legislative and judicial authorities with local and International law enforcement agencies working together to protect and secure privacy of citizens all the time thus they can relax for sure, isn't amazing?</div><div><br></div><div>There are numerous cool ways used by those who want to spy on someone or something back then like few centuries back people have no choice other then to physically spy themselves or using expert spys known as detectives like in Sherlock Holmes but since 18th century at that time of industrial revolution when we got many mechanical and electronic revolutionary technologies like camera and microphone recorders due to that the way people spy on anything changed drastically.</div><div><br></div><div>Camera is mechanical that will capture real life physical objects and microphone that records sounds of anything or anyone which are basically mechanical machines</div><div>at first they are basic like for instance camera in begginings was only able to capture in black and white mode on color papers known as photographs and when it comes to microphones they are capable of only recording sounds not play them back due to that cameras and microphones are in limited usages, isn't it dissapointing?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, majority of people thought camera and microphone are basic and has drawbacks yet back in early times they are revolutionary and amazed everyone which is why they widely used to them to make B/W aka black and white photographs and later on B/W silent moving pictures known as films then after few centuries we got to see B/W and colour photographs and films with sounds as well which are mostly used to make personal or commercial films but at that same time they're also used to spy as well which is why demand for cameras&nbsp;</div><div>and microphones grown exponentially.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, In order to supply demand for cameras and microphones many Inventors and companies over the years around the world continously upgraded them by using and adapting to thier own or third party technologies due to that in process now we have powerfull and advanced modern electronic cameras and microphones in Integration of digital technologies which can be used for all purposes conveniently and comfortably on the go efficiently.</div><div><br></div><div>Now a days, we have super small tiny cameras and microphones which once upon used to be big thanks to Inventors and companies who reduced size of cameras and microphones to supply demand and make business worldwide, which can capture super high resolution and definition quality photographs known as images and films known as videos developed using numerous programming languages basically softwares in different flexible digital format technologies.</div><div><br></div><div>Most people like few decades back primarly use cameras and microphones to make public films and music or songs formed out of sounds but there is big percentage of people and they are rapidly increasing day by day who are using them to spy legally or illegally as well due to that many Inventors and companies to make business and reach more audience keep on making better and improved latest spy cameras and microphones in that process now we have hard to detect ones by using them you can stay more anonymous.</div><div><br></div><div>The illegal surveillance spy incidents and cases are on rise in 21st century due to hard to detect powerful and advanced latest spy cameras and microphones which are available in super tiny sizes that's like no big wonder even it is an robotic mosquito spy camera but such types are super expensive and usually available with law enforcement agencies or&nbsp; big shots who can afford them, if you are common person with no big portfolio then may no one really spend that much money on you but they may instead use other affordable and reliable cameras or microphone to simply spy on you.</div><div><br></div><div>In most cases there may be chances that you may get spyed with super tiny camera and microphones basically recievers or transmitters that are hard to detect but not super hard like insects or birds eye etc instead they are mostly fitted somewhere in short or long distances where you can't easily access or go even if do you still you don't usually open and disamble them to check properly like TVs, bulbs, ACs, power boards and electronic devices.</div><div><br></div><div>However, you won't usually know either you're being spyed or not unless you got suspicious due to whatever reasons or somehow detected one or more spy cameras or microphones Isn't it? If you want to get rid of any spy cameras and microphones you need proper tools, if you are not criminal then you may report it to law enforcement agencies who usually have world class top notch military grade technologies to find them or you may also hire freelancers or private companies even you can purchase an try tools from online shopping websites but if you do all this work without knowledge and skills then you can't find any of them for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>But, almost all people mainly who're not aware of latest digital technologies or other whatever reasons don't report to law enforcement agencies even if they have doubt and suspicious of being spyed by someone, in many certain cases the law enforcement agencies spy and hide thier surveillance activities then lie to you mainly when they are corrupt which is why numerous people try to find all the spy cameras and microphones themselves manually or using spy detection electronic devices and which are quite expensive and not everyone can afford them, that's why alot of them find some affordable ways to do this job, ain't you one of them?</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we got to know one of the best and amazing spy cameras detection app basically always executable software for smartphones named Relief's Map that using AI aka artificial intelligence can effectively and automatically detect numerous types of spy cameras and using the camera of smartphones, thus you can use it very well wherever you feel suspicious in indoor or outdoor areas around you, so do you like it? are you interested in this Relief's Map? If yes then let's explore more.</div><div><br></div><div>Note : if you're someone who contacted and reported to law enforcement agencies and they informed that no spy cameras or microphone detected in all places and you sure that they are not lying about it and you also hired freelancers and private spy detection companies even buyed all spy tools to find them yet nothing then very likely you are spyed from long distance or there is chance that spy device is put in your body in that case you may have to go for total scanning from the trusted doctors thoroug and carefully so you can get back your privacy, and yeah it's up to you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>â€¢ Relief's Map official support â€¢</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Email : </b><a href="mailto:contact@spresto.net">contact@spresto.net</a></div><div><b>Website : </b><a href="http://www.spresto.net">www.spresto.net</a></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>â€¢ How to download Relief's Map â€¢</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>It is very easy to download that from these platforms for free.</div><div><br></div><div>- <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spresto.safe.android">Google Play</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>â€¢ Relief's Map key features and UI / UX overview â€¢</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
