</div><div><br></div><div><p dir="ltr">ARPANET aka Advanced Research Projects Agency Network in year 1969 created Internet which is standard protocol that provide unique IP address for identification to each electronic computer and then move digital data between computers, back then it is used to send digital messages between computers after that as time goes number of Inventors around the world continuously upgraded internet with numerous optimizations and enhancements for various purposes due to that we got much better functionalities on Internet to use extensively.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Internet though got alot of potential and capability by year 1980s with support of protocols like SMTP aka simple mail transfer protocol and POP aka post office protocol to send and receive long distance electronic emails inshort emails basically digital messages instantly between computers electronically and digitally which improved communication technologies drastically but internet at that time used to be private so you can't access it's content unless you get manual permissions from electronic computers.</p><p dir="ltr">In sense, the abilities of internet were limited to certain level as it's private but after long time in year 1991 Tim Berners Lee developed and released world wide web inshort www browser software developed using several programming languages for home compatible PCs aka personal computers which can access public contents of internet that are in website format basically software since then thanks to WWW usage of internet all over the world increased immensely.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, many people around the world since early era of internet started creating various different types of websites using .html aka hypertext markup language at first they are basic but eventually since web 2.0 era started in early 20th century majority of people started using better programming languages like css, php, javascript etc due to that we got powerful and advanced modern websites which not just look but also feel amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyhow, if you make any website in order to access them on browser you need to host it on internet isn't it? few decades back most people used to develop websites using PC softwares then using storage and memory make server that act as bridge to host websites on internet but it's bit lengthy process and suitable for small size websites not big ones due to less limited storage available on PCs which is why most people mainly newbies eventually shifted to cloud server hosting platforms, ain't you one of them?</p><p dir="ltr">In case, you don't know about cloud server hosting platforms then for you they are basically websites or softwares which in backend use physical storage and memory but provide them digitally for free or paid plans accessible on your browsers where you have to simply sign up with required details after that based on storage size and speed of memory you have to upload your website on it without storing locally thus you'll be able to access and manage your website on any PCs using WWW of internet conveniently and comfortably.</p><p dir="ltr">Especially, since early 20th century almost all people using big and fast cloud server hosting platforms except some people who want more control with privacy and security of their websites but at the end you use any local or cloud server hosting platforms once website is published on Internet it should have short length url aka uniform resource locator domain address and load fast then only people were able to access and read contents of websites quickly and easily on the go.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though, the website load time on browser depends on distance and speed of cloud server and internet network data speed but that's not all there are number of different other factors involved as well like to name few foremost it's based on code of website if it's small size and simple then it load instantly but if the website is huge size and complex one then even if your internet data speed is super fast and the browser you used to open website is best on internet still it definitely take some time for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, we have giga byte speed internet data and numerous modern powerful and advanced browsers softwares availabile for PCs and other electronic devices like smartphones which are in-built designed to be capable of loading websites of huge size as fast as possible yet still it's important to reduce loadtime of websites either for personal or commercial projects as people like and prefer to view websites quickly which is important for SEO aka search engine optimization as well, don't you think?</p><p dir="ltr">Generally, In order to reduce load time you have to reduce and simplify even remove alot of code on websites which is not always possible isn't it? as sometimes certain lengthy code is crucial and important to make websites work correctly and efficiently right? which is why people whoever can't make adjustments to website code started using CDNs aka content delivery networks which are now in wide usage globally.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Akamai started CDNs in year 1998 after that many companies started making thier own CDNs which all basically accelerate web content of website by parsing and storing lengthy code of website on super fast decentralized cloud servers worldwide then they provide short url which you can add on website so whenever someone load your website then CDN will fetch code it automatically which increase website load speed as the code is fetched using near cloud server to visitors more quickly.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Now a days, in 21st century of modern world digital technologies almost all people and companies using CDNs like cloudflare, amazon, google cloud etc to improve and increase speed of websites drastically which is beneficial for creators and companies to provide website content to visitors blazing speed but the problem with them is CDNs parse lengthy code and fetch only when website loads on browser&nbsp; due to that if you are visitor you will not know what code is stored on CDN unless you decided open and review it.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, majority of CDNs used by websites most times load content quickly and safe but sometimes if CDNs for whatever reason go down then it will break websites and as CDNs parse and store lengthy code in cloud server it can altered from CDN side including that certain websites may use trackers with CDNs to collect data or recommend personalized advertisements etc unknowingly that can be problematic to your online privacy.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't like any or some CDNs may be you have doubt about trackers or they are not working right now then to fix this we have very few options first you have to filter and block CDNs which you think are suspicious using softwares but it can break websites if you don't that to happen then you can use local centralized CDNs.</p><p dir="ltr">There are very few local centralized CDN libraries which stop requests to CDNs using local CDN files in that way website usually don't break content at the same time you get online privacy but most local centralized CDNs are not available as external softwares instead at present them they are available as extensions for browsers that to for PCs, we have cope with it right now.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, we revisited decentraleyes which is one of the first local centralized CDN created in year 2015 which is now upgraded to 2.0 and availabile for Mozilla, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Chrome etc that protect against tracking using free and fast local emulation centralized content delivery, so do you it?
