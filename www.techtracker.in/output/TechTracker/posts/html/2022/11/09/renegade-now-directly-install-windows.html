</div><br></div><div>In mid 19th century many inventors mainly in America created electronic computers which is evolution of computers powered by electricity then after that in just just few years inventors found way to run software on processor of electronic computers at first they used to don't have monitor and visible format softwares but by year 1960s</div><div>we got digital CLI - command line interface operating systems that extended potential and capabilities of them extensively.</div><div><br></div><div>But, electronic computers back then used to be big and expensive due to that not everyone can afford them except few people and big companies at that time companies around the world for personal or commercial reasons keep on reducing size of electronic computers by Integrating and adapting to new technologies in that process by year 1970s we got to see less size and expensive home computers.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div>The usage of Android operating system on smartphones grown exponentially in just few years thanks to mobile companies who used to make and release expensive and affordable low cost Android powered smarphones due to that Android is now dominant mobile operating system with more then 70% market share and then in second place goes to iOS so it's possible that you may also using Android now.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, both iOS and Android are nice in it's space but at the end they are mobile operating systems including that they lack many certain options and features that are already available on PCs due to that even if you mostly use either iOS or Android still sometimes you have to rely on PCs isn't? but in case you don't have or want to use PC instead like and prefer to do everything in smartphones then there are few ways to get desktop operating systems on them.</div><div><br></div><div>Usually, it is not possible to directly install desktop operating systems on mobiles and smartphones due to hardware and software differences but some developers created emulators softwares using many compatible programming languages where they embedded virtual environment of PC hardware and software digitally which is hard but by using them you can sideload&nbsp; and run PC softwares on Android easily like on Limbo and Exagear emulators.</div><div><br></div><div><b><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/05/how-to-run-windows-10-on-android.html">+ How to run Windows 10 on Android without root using Limbo Emulator.</a></b></div><div><br></div><div><b><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/05/how-to-install-windows-softwares-on.html">+ How to install Windows softwares on Android using ExaGear Emulator.</a></b></div><div><br></div><div>If you don't want to use emulators to install PC operating systems on smartphones then you may mirror PC using softwares like Airdroid or get cloud PC services which are way better then running desktop operating system on smartphone emulators but in case you neither want anyone of them instead want to directly run on smartphones then luckily there is one method available for you.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we re-went to project named Renegede created by group who want to run everything on smartphones to check out and thought to show you which allows you to directly install and run Windows 11 desktop operating system on compatible and supported arm68 architecture Android powered smartphones as of now, so do you like it? are you interested in Renegede project?
