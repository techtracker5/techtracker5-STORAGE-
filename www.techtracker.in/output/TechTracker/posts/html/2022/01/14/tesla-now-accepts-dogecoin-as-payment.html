</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Cyberwhistle is a limited edition premium collectable made from&nbsp; medical grade stainless with a polished finish inspired from CyberTruck, Elon musk says Don't waste your money on that silly Apple Cloth, buy our whistle instead!, which is one of reason Cyberwhistle got out of stock in few minutes.</div><div><br></div><div>What's next? Out of stock, is a good sign for future, even though many people were unable to buy Cybertruck but if Tesla and Elon Musk feel Dogecoin as payment method worked out then Tesla may in future also accepts Dogecoin as payment to buy Tesla electric cars, it is possible unless US government laws &amp; regulations on crypto currencies change over the time.</div><div><br></div><div>However, here the question arises why only dogecoin and not Shiba inu or Baby dogecoin which are also promoted by Elon Musk, that's a valid point but according to Elon Musk Dogecoin is more efficient and effective interms of transactions so may be that could be the reason or Elon Musk first favorite crypto coin is Dogecoin so he may preferred it over others.</div><div><br></div><div>But, I think Dogecoin as payment method is stepping stone of adding more crypto coins as payment method to buy Tesla products in near future and yeah for sure there is no guarantee and it takes alot of time, so let's hope for the best, but always remember buying and investing on crypto coins are subjected to market risks.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, Today on Dec 14 2021 Dogecoin investors and holders are more happy then they ever before as from now Tesla accepts Dogecoin as payment to buy merchandise which not only increase Dogecoin price but also futuristic step towards crypto payments, what do you think about this? have you purchased Cyberwhistle using Dogecoin?
