</div><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">1980 is the year considered as start of digital revolution as around that time only we got to see many evolutions of existing electronic devices and technologies like</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">for instance electronic computer which is used to be big machine in size of room or car that was only able to execute real life tasks electronically but thanks to number of companies as part of digital revolution for personal or commercial reasons they from time to time updated and upgraded electronic computer by adapting to latest technologies in that process they evolved to quite small size home compatible PCs aka personal computers which are able to execute almost all real life tasks digitally.</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">PCs are powered by either CLI aka command line interface or GUI aka graphical user interface operating system which are basically software developed using number of programming languages like C, C++, Python etc on that you can install additional softwares created by developers around the world to do various different things electronically and digitally back then PCs used to be basic and bit expensive due to that not everyone could afford and use PCs but as there is huge demand to supply that many companies continously increased capabilities of PCs hardware and software accordingly to sell and make business worldwide due to that we got powerful and advanced PCs.</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">Since, the early era of digital revolution PCs are not just widely used for personal but also for work purposes which is why they are also known as workstations including that they are also used to play digital games though as said earlier back then almost all PCs used to be basic so most developers used to develop and release basic digital softwares and games but eventually they started making heavy resources digital softwares and games as to handle them we got modern PCs which have powerful and advanced hardware and software to execute electronic and digital tasks more efficiently and effectively.</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">In sense, now we have modern workstation and gaming PCs which are widely used by people around the world just like many electronic devices PCs are made up of numerous hardware parts like cpu, ram, rom, graphics card etc which you can simply remove whenever you want and add better ones to replace damaged parts or even degrade or upgrade them in order to improve battery life or performance etc unlike smartphones and laptops where all the main parts are sealed so unless you're a skilled technician it's bit hard to remove and replace them so people whoever don't like such thing right on go with PCs.</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">Eventhough, you can buy fully build Integrated parts PC from many makers but thing is they are little bit costly including that if you buy fully build one then you have to go with pre-available parts after that only you'll be able to replace them which not everyone like as many people have custom PC requirements that's why they want to build their own PC right from&nbsp; scratch according to their requirements to use as workstation or gaming PC etc but thing is building own PCs though saves money as you can choose your own parts based on budget still at the end it's hard unless you know about PCs very well with experience in&nbsp; building own PCs if you're not then you'll find it difficult for sure.</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">if you know how to pick parts and build your own workstation or gaming PC then it's fine but not everyone does large percentage of people don't know how to do all this out of them many people for first time buying or trying to build their own PC which is why a lot of people take long time in researching about various different parts of PCs and it's prices but thing is picking parts and building own PC is quite time taking and lengthy process for anyone which is why some people who unable to build their own PC for whatever reasons most likely buy fully build PCs or to get help hire skilled expert from online platforms like Fiverr or offline technicians who usually charge some money.</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">In case, you don't want to pay or get free help from anyone in building your own PC then it's fine if you are wishing to learn there are many workstation and PC building tutorials on platforms like YouTube which you can watch over and over until you finally get it done though it takes time at the end it's totally worthy but thing is picking parts to build your own PC is difficult then other tasks you have to first make list of them then visit number of online or offline shopping platforms where you have to check many PCs parts out of them pick right ones based on budget and custom PC isn't it? what if you can auto pick them it will be amazing right?</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;"><br></div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">Recently, we got to know about app named PC builder which has many options and features to name few compatibility check,</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">estimated Wattage, daily price update, custom parts, custom currency converter</div><div class="separator" style="text-align: start; clear: both;">etc mainly you can simply set your country and budget of custom PCs of parts then based on that it will right on automatically suggest you numerous PCs parts from number of online shopping platforms which you can visit to buy them then plan to build your own workstation or gaming PC anywhere and anytime conveniently and comfortably, so do you like it? are you interested?
