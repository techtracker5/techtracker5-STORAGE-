</div><div><br></div><div>Real estate is basically name of industry in which people rent, buy or sell properties like normal or agriculture lands, houses, apartments, villas, mansions etc, since ancient times land properties basically assets always had huge value as they are necessary for people in this world to live conveniently and comfortably back then there is no name for this business in whole but eventually it is named as real estate.</div><div><br></div><div>When industrial revolution begin in early 18th century at that time people started building various different factories to make commercial products and sell them locally or worldwide but sufficient land is required to setup factories which is why businessmans at quite large scale started buying lands even converted agriculture lands into normal ones due to all of this&nbsp; real estate slowly begin shaping up as an industry which got recognition globally.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, In 19th century industrial revolution rapidly growing around the world at that time many businessmans for personal mainly for commercial purposes&nbsp; started buying and selling lands, houses, apartments etc in numerous ways to people which increased competition among businessmans due to that real estate business reached new heights though there are ups and downs time to time like any other business but now real estate industry worth more then&nbsp;US$ 7,063 billion worldwide, isn't that amazing?</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, since ancient times In order to rent, buy or sell lands, houses, apartments etc we exchange properties or pay and take money in form of paper based fiat currency isn't it?
