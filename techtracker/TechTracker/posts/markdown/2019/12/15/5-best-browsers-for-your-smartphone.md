<div>
<br></div>
<div>
1. Chrome</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
Old style, chrome may not be new but this browser was from tech giant google, tech experts do agree chrome was the only browser that loads original webpage, however it has some data saver options that will increase the load speed, a must try for real web experience.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
2. Brave Browser</div>
<div>

<div>
Kiwi is a browser which loads the webpages rusing thier own optimized servers, it was simple and beautiful, also it uses chromium websystem which was added advantage some reviews say that its better than chrome.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
4. Via</div>

<br></div>
<div>
Less size big things, feature packed in 500kb size you won't believe what this browser will do,</div>
<div>
