</div><div><br></div><div>On planet earth, Humans invented many products to travel faster out of them car is revolutionary product build using number of mechanical parts and an single or several engines that power up to move it's wheels and travel wherever you like at first cars are basic with low powered engine thus it used to move slower but eventually because of companies for commercial reasons we got fast racing cars.</div><div><br></div><div>However, in society for various reasons people always want to compete with each other due to that since long time cars not just used for travel but also to race with slow or fast racing cars doesn't matter for enjoyment or money etc but car racing without safety measures is risky you can end up with fatal injuries which is why it's better to do car racing in approved tracks.</div><div><br></div><div>We have numerous car racing tracks in almost all countries and most of them are&nbsp; approved by government which follow all safety measures like they keep in touch with technicians, fire, medical department thus if any accident happens in race track they will immediately there to help you but in order to enter and to do car racing in tracks is super expensive.</div><div><br></div><div>Usually, you can do car racing anywhere but on race track it can cost millions which not everyone can afford that's why racers rely on sponsors who only approve after analysing your skills and other numerous things that's hard and takes time so if you are into car racing already then it's fine but in case you are under 18 years and never done car racing for whatever reasons then you can simply rely on digital car games.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, car racing games can't provide real life car racing experience but some what can satisfy you with real car names and sounds with exciting levels that can increase your adrenaline and get you the little feel of real car racing if you totally involved in it so many companies and developers since the beginning era of PCs aka personal computers build millions of car racing games that are widely used by people around the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Digital car racing games are softwares developed using numerous programming languages which are packed with alot of 2D or 3D graphics in one file that can be installed and run on supported operating system available on electronic devices at first PCs used to be only device that can run digital games but later on thanks to Inventors and developers we are able to install and run digital games on modern mobile phones, home gaming consoles like Sony PS series and smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>PCs and home gaming consoles are equipped with powerful hardware and software thus you can run high graphic heavy resources at smooth FPS rate but on modern mobile phones hardware and software is not capable so you can only install and run less resources 2D graphic games due to that most modern mobile phone gamers shifted to smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Smartphones came after modern mobile phones which also comes with powerful hardware and software thus you can install and run better graphic car digital games then mobile companies but not yet reached the level of PCs and home gaming consoles so you may find many high graphic PC games incompatible and unsupported on smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>But, mobile companies because of commercial reasons in this capitalist world keep on increasing the capacity of hardware and software of smartphones due to that now a days smartphones are capable to run few high graphic PC games and the list will increase soon in future.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, in sense now you can run high graphic car racing games on smartphones there are millons of low and high graphic 2D and 3D graphic car racing games available for smartphones but most people in 21st century prefer and like to play 3D games out of them Asphalt car racing games series by Gameloft inc. is most popular globally.</div><div><br></div><div>Majority of car racing games are fully packed with high octance graphics which is great as people like them but most of them are not based on movies isn't? but recently we found an amazing and super cool kart racing game named Toy Rider that has slight touch of popular and well known animated movie Toy Story and Cars.</div><div><br></div><div>Toy Story and Cars has undoubtedly one of most animated car racing movies that has good story lineup where Toys themselves play as characters that connects people so if you like Toy movies then Toy Rider is for you because over there you will find Toy cars communicate and race against each other in home and other places, isn't awesome?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Toy Rider is offline mobile racing game where you'll get power ups to speed up and plenty of cars with subscriptions like any other regular car game but what make it different is beside speed you also have to properly balance and time in a miniature home environment inspired by Table Top racing and Micromachine games with alot of required improvements and upgrades, so do you like it?
