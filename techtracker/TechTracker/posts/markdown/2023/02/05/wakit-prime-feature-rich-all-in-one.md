</div><div><br></div><div>SMS aka short messaging service is a revolutionary digital communication technology though it has long history but the world's first SMS stating Merry Christmas was sent by Neil Papworth in year December 3, 1992 to the Orbitel 901 mobile phone of his colleague Richard Jarvis back then SMS is revolutionary and pretty useful at that time it was rolled out to many cellular networks commercially since then large percentage of people around the world to communicate on mobile phones started using SMS.</div><div><br></div><div>In order to send or receive SMS from anyone you must require some cellular network connected to your mobile phone&nbsp;</div><div>which usually charge money for providing this and any other additional services as per opted subscription plans accordingly at first SMS used to be basic but later on for personal or commercial reasons many cellular networks done numerous updates and upgrades on SMS by adapting to new technologies due to that not only the SMS character length increased but also it got functionality to send many digital files like images, videos, audios, mms etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Eventhough, SMS facility provided by cellular networks is undoubtedly amazing technology that rapidly increased digital communication and connected people around the world wirelessly but thing is at the end like any other technology SMS has some drawbacks like text character length and digital file size limit including that when you send SMS with cellular network it's most likely not encrypted which makes it not secure and reliable that's why some people don't like and prefer SMS instead choose e-mail or social networks etc.</div><div><br></div><div>E-mail basically means electronic mail which is one of the oldest digital text based communication technology that existed way before SMS which is available in form of software at first for electronic computer and later on developers created email for other electronic devices as well which very likely encrypt and can send more text character and digital file size messages but thing is even e-mail lacks numerous functionalities that are provided by social networks so large percentage of people whoever want them started using social network platforms on the go.</div><div><br></div><div>Social networks are also softwares developed using number of programming languages which are created to improve communication and connect with people worldwide but thing is they are likely use and hosted on internet which is a standard protocol inshort IP created by ARPANET to move data on network between electronic computers at first in the beginning social networks are available as websites which are basically online softwares linked with url aka uniform resource locator available in form of number or text that you can only access using world wide web browser.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://Sixdegrees.com">Sixdegrees.com</a>&nbsp;is widely considered as world's first social network website on Internet that is accessible on world wide web after that many developers around the world for personal or commercial reasons created their own social network by adapting to latest technologies in that process we got way better feature rich social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc by using them you can not just message but also create personal profile and publish digital media content or files in private or public mode including that you will get many more things which you may won't usually find on regular SMS.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, whenever you message to someone you connected on social network it will travel through Internet for that all you need is sufficient data provided by your cellular or broadband wifi network on PC aka personal computer or any other electronic device like mobile phones or smartphones etc as long you have it you can use social networks but thing is some people don't like and prefer to use social networks as they want more simple form of communication online for them over the years to supply demand many companies and developers created and released quite amazing instant messaging platforms.</div><div><br></div><div>There are many Instant messaging websites and softwares out of them WhatsApp Messenger is one of most popular and widely used one around the world created by&nbsp;Brian Acton and Jan Koum which is now owned by Meta Platforms that has end to end message encryption for security and privacy including that it has numerous other options and features to communicate conveniently and comfortably but thing is there are few things lacking in WhatsApp which are very much required by some people so to provide them externally many developers created WhatsApp Toolkits.</div><div><br></div><div>We have numerous WhatsApp Toolkits which are very useful to those who use WhatsApp everyday, if you're someone who regularly use WhatsApp and want a toolkit to use it way better then before then recently we got to pick a feature rich WhatsApp toolkit named WAKit Prime that you may definitely like to use for sure, so do you like it? are
