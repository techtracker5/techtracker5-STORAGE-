There are many revolutionary technologies which we use every day out of them QR code is one that is used by many people and almost all companies on their products and services to sell and make business worldwide.</div><div><br></div><div>You may already know about QR and bar code isn't it? but if you don't know then for you in simple usually when you buy some product from registered and licensed maker then you very likely going to find QR or bar code printed on it by it's maker or company which you can scan with right scanner software to verify it's geniunity then once done based on result you can decide either to use it or not further.</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, you can generate QR and bar code of almost anything using right software which is usually in matrix barcode or two-dimensional barcode that will be added on digital image then after that you can print it on products or share it with people but until you or someone scan the QR or barcode with scanner the hidden thing won't open anytime and anywhere.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, QR code act as cover up to something that you may don't want to show publicly instead the digital thing basically get encrypted in QR and barcode which is pretty useful at times like for Instance in case of your address or wifi network password which you may don't want to show directly for any reasons but like and prefer to let someone know about it in such scenario generating an QR or barcode for them provide privacy.</div><div><br></div><div>However, majority of people and companies generate QR or barcode for things which they want to show publicly and make people know and discover about them but at the end once QR or barcode generated and available on something then you have to scan it with the scanner using good digital camera else it may not be able to recognize QR and barcodes of anything, isn't that bit dissapointing?</div><div><br></div><div>But, even if you have any bad camera still in case you already have digital QR code on your device then also you can detect them using scanner softwares which scan images right on your device digitally then present backend information of QR and barcodes but in order to to create, scan or save QR code and barcodes you need right software or app to use on the go.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we got to know about an feature rich modern&nbsp; super cool app named QRKy that not just scan but also make QR and barcodes of website, text, wifi, email, contact, event, location, text, phone, sms, and my QR etc efficiently and effectively so do you like it? are you interested in QRky?
