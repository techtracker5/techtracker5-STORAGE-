</div><div><br></div><div>SIM aka subscriber identity module is basically a chip that you may probably using on your mobiles and smartphones&nbsp; extensively isn't it? If so you may have seen it number of times right? It comes in different sizes based on device to fit well which back is coated with very thin layer of gold so don't ever think to sell it you'll get 0$ unless it's an antique but with just that and unique serial number you can do alot of things as sim card basically work as bridge between you and your telecom network to access all their services like voice calls, sms, internet data and many more which is very revolutionary wireless communication technology that connects people around the world effectively.</div><div><br></div><div>Usually, there will be number of small or big telecom operators or you may call networks in most countries unless it's undeveloped one and each country put strict terms and conditions on telecom companies as communication technology that they provide to citizens and people in their country has pros and cons which is why governments establish a personal body to regulate them like for Instance TRAI aka telecom regulatory authority of India and release legal statements like that no telecom operator can provide sim cards to anyone unless they provide all necessary government documents like social security number, passport, driving licence etc after that they should verify details and process it if geniune and then activate that simcard in 24 hours so that no can use it in bulk or for illegal purposes etc all this protocols made for safety.</div><div>.</div><div>Each sim card comes with unique 10 digit number pre-set by telecom operator which all only work if we add country code in start of it like for Instance united states has +1 as country code based on sim card number there will be price set by telecom operator like for normal random number you'll mostly pay regular price but for specialized custom number with same number repeated times popularly known as fancy number you have to pay big price which is why except few people and huge companies majority of people worldwide use common ones at the end any number normal or expensive ones doesn't matter users in most cases get same simcard as it's such small size that we can't do much on externally even if you do in most cases you'll not inject out of device as nowadays it become part of ourselves isn't it?</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, most telecom networks use plastic to make sim card with very thin layer of gold or silver coating that has no value unless you collected tons of sim cards but the technology which it unleash when connected to electronic device is precious that provide numerous value added services wirelessly to users in location wherever the telecom network is available constantly unless there is any issues in telecom network or bad weather conditions etc and yeah to access and use value added telecom services you must have to buy a prepaid or postpaid simcard and recharge it with flexible monthly or annually plans whenever you want from offline stores or online portals very easily due to such potential and user-friendliness of sim cards there is large userbase which is more than WiFi thanks to such demand and to be up to date almost all telecom operators upgrading sim cards internally by adapting to latest technologies.</div><div><br></div><div>But thing is as you may know sim cards that we use now is same plastic ones that we used a decade ago ever wondered why is it like this when since long time it's internal technologies being upgraded well to put in simple in my opinion there's no need for it and a lot of people face issues handling physical sim cards out of them most people don't even like or prefer to use them due to various different reasons to name few sim cards can be damaged just simple scratch or break on it's back thin layer make it unusable and if you use many sim cards it is bit difficult to manage them unless your device has multiple slots which are few drawbacks so to eradicate them for the first time Apple inc. back in year 2017 on it's X series smartphones introduced a revolutionary technology known as esim aka electronic sim.</div><div><br></div><div>However, even after number of years e-sim is not widely available on smartphones except premium flagship smartphones have you ever wondered why? e-sim is integrated into your device but to enable you're interested telecom operator must support it though at first most telecom operators used to don't have support for e-sim technology but eventually thanks to popularity of Apple inc. many devices and telecom started adding it yet still 90% of smartphones don't have it because of whatever reasons majority of companies didn't add on low and budget smartphones isn't that quite dissapointing? though e-sim setup takes more times than normal sim cards yet thanks to it's electronic modern technology large percentage of people want to use them on unsupported smartphones which is directly not possible unless you have skills to do the job.</div><div><br></div><div>In sense, if you don't have much technical indept skills then you very much won't be able to directly add and use e-sim on unsupported devices but Incase you definitely want to somehow use the e-sim technology on unsupported devices then for people like you I recently got to know about an futuristic company named e-sim.me that provides a sim card physical one but connect on smartphone with the help of its proprietary technology and app it can store more then 15 sim card profiles which work in every sim slot supported device and country though current price is quite expensive in some countries but it's path breaking technology with support for thousands of devices and usefulness is surely outstanding, don't you think?</div><div><br></div><div>e-sim.me is new technology in market that didn't got much spotlight as of now that will surely get more recognition in future as it can convert existing physical sim cards into digital ones at present it is purchasable on official portal and ships worldwide though it's already amazing with just one sim you'll be able to use more then 10 e-sims but it will be way more awesome if e-sim.me was able to put out a technology or you can may say trick or method that can add e-sims on unsupported devices without any physical simcard from e-sim.me as well don't you think? at present the availability of this technology is no doubt is quite fulfilling for those who require this immediately, are you one of them? do you like it? are you interested?
