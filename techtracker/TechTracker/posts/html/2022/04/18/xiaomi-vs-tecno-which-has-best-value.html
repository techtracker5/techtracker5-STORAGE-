Then Xiaomi simply replied stating that we will sell our smartphones with only 2 to 4% profits margin and sometimes we don't take profits.</div><div><br></div><div>In case of big companies like Samsung they take 8 to 16% margin profits on it's products and they also pay commission to offline stores to sell it's products, that's why they're priced high but eventually Samsung and other mobile companies understood that they have to go in path of Xiaomi to sustain in developing countries as they're sells are dropping they have no choice other then start making value for money budget smartphones which are comparable to Xiaomi mobiles like for example : Samsung M series.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks to Xiaomi, many companies who make budget smartphones from china started entering into other country mobile markets like RealMe, Nubia, Meizu and Tecno etc as they understand the potential of developing countries, even though some companies like Nubia and Meizu failed yet RealMe and Tecno now a days giving edge to edge competition to Xiaomi.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, Tecno mobiles from Trannsion has amazing value of money smartphones that are better then Xiaomi in many cases, Transsion unlike Xiaomi they're more interested in Africa and want to focus on developing Africa so they setup it's mobile manufacturing plant back in 2009 and become top mobile brand in Africa.</div><div><br></div><div>But, Transsion also want to globalize it's smartphones so they eventually started entering into developing countries mobile market like India, bangladesh, vietnam, pakistan like Xiaomi and got success, now they are moving forward and making strategies to dominate mobile market of developed countries like USA, EU etc where people prefer Apple or Samsung flagship smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Tecno didn't give any statements on it's profit margin but yeah Tecno like Xiaomi only sell it's smartphones on online shopping platforms like Amazon, Flipkart etc, if you're someone who prefer value for money smartphones then you may most likely know Tecno smartphones provide value for money budget smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>But, many people when they want to buy budget smartphone choose Xiaomi as they are not aware of Tecno, if you're someone who want to buy smartphones but confused or don't know which has best value for money smartphones is either Xiaomi or Tecno? then don't worry we are going to help you to decide on your own, so are you ready?

</div><br></div><div><b>• Hardware •</b></div><div><br></div><div>Both Xiaomi and Tecno provide good quality smartphone based on price, but Xiaomi usually add atleast Gorilla 3 glass, incase of Tecno they didn't mention which glass they use yet considering our usage Tecno smartphones surprisingly survived many drops with no scratches, however for whatever odd reason Xiaomi some times launch few smartphones with terrible low quality hardware for instance MI A series.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>• Battery •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Xiaomi and Tecno like any other budget smartphone has lithium based batteries, and both adds either 5000 or 6000 Mah capacity battery on budget smartphones with 10 or 18kw fast charging support, however battery life depends on numerous factors like battery quality, usage patterns, software and hardware optimization etc. It seems like both smartphones comes with big and quality battery for sure.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><b>• Design •</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Design is very important as it's the first thing you see and feel, Xiaomi and Tecno has plastic backs on majority of it's budget smartphones with numerous and different, designs, so as each individual has thier own preference you can choose between Xiaomi and Tecno, I personally like Tecno.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, Xiaomi is well known popular mobile company, while Tecno is uprising mobile company, There is no doubt both companies smartphone brands has thier own upsides and downsides, but the fact is Tecno beats Xiaomi smartphones in many areas especially in terms of pricing, so you can definitely consider Tecno as best alternative to Xiaomi, according to my analysis and opinion I say Tecno has best value for money smartphones over Xiaomi, do say what do yo think? and mention why you like Xiaomi or Tecno in our comment section below, see ya :)</div><div></div></div>
