</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The era of digital games begin when computers are integrated with operating systems basically softwares since year 1962 many companies and developers using several programming languages developed video games but back then computers are not in wide usage as they are big and expensive so only millionaires and big companies can afford them.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, by 1970s we got less expensive small and home compatible PCs aka personal computers with better hardware and advanced softwares which are capable to play thousands of amazing digital video games but at the end they are not designed for gaming you can do many more tasks electronically and digitally so not everyone like to buy them especially kids who just want to play video games.</div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, many companies around the world for people who can't afford or don't like to use computers and just to want to play video games without any distractions developed and released arcade machines which can play video games but there are few drawbacks arcade machines are quite big and expensive like computers but it is capable of generating revenue via pay and use system so large percentage of offline stores used to buy and setup them.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, arcade machine video games quickly got immense popularity around the world as people of all ages especially kids and teens used to play them going to locations wherever available mainly to game saloons due to that it got huge success and eventually over the years withvadvancements we got better and modern arcade machine video games.</div><div><br></div><div>But, people irrespective of age can't always go to outside offline stores and drop pennies every time to play video games due to various reasons alot of people want to play computer and arcade machine in home comfortably which is definitely possible when you have enough money to maintain and space to fit arcade machines in home or anywhere else.</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, majority of people unable to put arcade video game machines in home for whatever reasons but it will be super cool if we have better user friendly alternative to arcade video game machines right? at the time we got home video game consoles that you should connect to Television to play set of supported video games first developed and released by company Magnavox in year 1972 named Odyssey.</div><div><br></div><div>Odyssey is world's first home video game console after that numerous inventors and companies around the world started competing with each other and making thier own version of home video game console with different design, hardware&nbsp; and software with advancements adapting to latest technologies accordingly due to that we are in era of amazing modern home video game consoles.</div><div><br></div><div>Home video game consoles comes with plug and play system which is one time purchase they are not only small in size but also very easy to maintain and use convieniently anywhere and anytime at your comfortable zone due to it's super flexibility almost all arcade video game machine users eventually shifted to home video game consoles globally.</div><div><br></div><div>Sega inc. is one of the most popular home video game console maker that released it's first home video game console in year 1985 named Sega CD with final release Dreamcast in year which is an commercial failure due to that Sega inc. end up with huge losses after that they discontinued it's home console bussines and shifted it's focus on making video games for popular home video game consoles.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, we have poweful hardware and advanced software home video game consoles world which have potential and capability to play high definition intensive graphics heavy resources video games which provide immersive experience via additional technologies like mixed reality but still alot of people want to play old home console video games mainly because of nostalgia reasons.</div><div><br></div><div>In case you want to play old Sega video games then you have to buy Sega home consoles released prior year 2001 which Sega inc. stopped manufacturing and selling long time ago so you can't get new ones but there are several websites where you can buy some old home Sega home video console consoles but price is way&nbsp; higher then normal as they are rare.</div><div><br></div><div>However, it is possible that you may not found some Sega home video game consoles even if did still it's definitely not worthy to buy them now because we are in 21st century of modern PCs aka personal computers and smartphones with super advanced digital technologies which have unofficial emulator softwares by using them you can play almost all Sega inc. home console videos games for free.</div><div><br></div><div>Unofficial emulators are developed by third party developers using various programming languages in digital format&nbsp; supported by personal computers and smarphones which provide an virtual operating system that emulates hardware of home video game console in software where you can externally load and run home console video games.</div><div><br></div><div>Personal computers and smartphones can't directly run home console video games due to hardware and software differences so you have no choice other then to use unofficial emulators which don't get any support from official home video game console makers due to that third party developers have to write thier own code from scratch to emulate home video game console hardware in software that's difficult and takes time.</div><div><br></div><div>Third party developers usually have to debug and fix bugs noticed and reported by users when using unofficial emulator or while playing video games which is why many unofficial emulators stay in early access or alpha phase for few years with only some compatible games and devices but to fast track developement since long publishing un-official emulator code as FOSS aka free and open source via public repositores on platforms like GitHub.</div><div><br></div><div>GitHub for Instance is contributive development platforms where anyone on web after registration can contribute thier code then commit them to public repositores to update or upgrade software with optimizations and bugs fixes etc due to that unofficial emulators now a days taking less time to become stable.</div><div><br></div><div>Smartphones which came to replace keypad mobile phones have many unofficial video games emulators but some of them are unavailable that are currently existed on personal computers especially modern video game unofficial emulators because of incapable hardware and software but companies upgrading smartphones with increase in ROM and RAM regularly and third party developers also striving to release or port computer new unofficial emulators to smartphones so we may get in future for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile, personal computers support more unofficial emulators because of it's powerful hardware and advanced software which has potential and capability to manage and run modern home console video games proper with less bugs that's why majority of third party developers focus and give first priority to develop unofficial video game emulators for personal computers but due to demand from users they are concentrating on smartphones as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, In case of Sega home console video games they are quite old and basic due to that third party developers are efficiently able to create many stable unofficial emulators with numerous options and features for smartphones as it has upgraded powered up CPU and GPU&nbsp; to play any old Sega video games in high FPS rate efficiently.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we found an free and open source no ads unofficial emulator cross platform software with support for Android powered smartphones named RetroArch which has Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, Master System, Saturn, Dreamcast, Mark III, Game Gear, CD, SG 1000, 32X video games cores that you have to simply download to start playing instantly, so do you like it? are you interested in RetroArch?
