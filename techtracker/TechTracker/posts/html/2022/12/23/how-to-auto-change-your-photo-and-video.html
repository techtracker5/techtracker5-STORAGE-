</div><div><br></div><div>Anime is basically created using colors where artists draw fictional characters then make story play out of them, few decades back creators used to create anime using traditional methods where they have to draw each and every fictional character movement which is super hard and difficult for anyone unless you are an expert in this job that's why it used to take long time to make and release animes.</div><div><br></div><div>There are numerous well known and popular animes like for Instance Dragon Ball which once upon on a time made using traditional methods but eventually when electronic computers with software entered in this world the way people make and watch anime changed completely with that people started making animes directly from computer which is way better though it takes some time to master it once done you can develop animes much faster then the traditional methods for sure.</div><div><br></div><div>On electronic computers, animes are made on softwares which are specifically made for that purpose created using number of programming languages like C, C++ etc then they process them using hardware technology like storage and memory etc which is amazing so almost all companies and creators eventually shifted to electronic computers to make any type animes efficiently on the go.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, in order to make animes there are many powerful and advanced softwares and hardware on electronic computers but the thing is not everyone make and watch animes there is an alternative that majority of people like and prefer over anime which are photographs inshort photos and films captured using camera that're now known&nbsp;</div><div>as images and videos as they are captured in digital formats using digital cameras.</div><div><br></div><div>Camera of any type can capture whatever you seeing in this world due to that people by using it made photos and films using people and real world physical objects which are in existent for more then 2 centuries now and widely enjoyed by large percentage of people around the world but there are certain percentage of people who like to make and watch anime over photos and films, are you one of them?</div><div><br></div><div>Usually, when you want to make anime version of any photo or video you have to manually make them from scratch which takes long time mainly when you want to clone each frame of it but since long time many people and companies for personal and commercial reasons making animated version of photos and films to reach each and everyone isn't that super cool?</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, it is now capable to manually make any photo and video into anime thanks to modern tools but what if you want to turn photo or video into anime automatically? few decades back it's not possible but now we have AI aka Artificial Intelligence that by using machine learning and some other technologies can turn any photos and videos into anime.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, we got to know about an app named PicSo that has many options and features which not just turn images and videos but also text into different types of animes and cartoon on smartphones using AI aka Artificial Intelligence, so do you like it? are you interested in PicSo?
