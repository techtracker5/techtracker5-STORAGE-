</div><div><br></div><div>In year 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto a unknown person introduced and released decentralized crypto currency named Bitcoin based on Web3 concept alternative to fiat currency that uses super modern technology due to that with in few years Bitcoin popularity and price increased and then developers around the world started making thier own crypto currencies with necessary platforms whenever required.</div><div><br></div><div>Crypto currencies are very secure and provide full security that are created to replace middle mans like banks but in early days of crypto currencies we don't have many platforms except hardware wallets thus people don't have many&nbsp; options they used to buy specific crypto currency or token then store it on crypto hardware wallets to sell them to people or on CEX aka centralized exchanges.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully, now we have thousands of crypto currencies and millons of tokens in crypto world which has huge market thus we got centralized and decentralized crypto currencies where you can sell or trade crypto currencies and tokens same as stock market but crypto currencies are much more modern then stock market so to control and store them better we got several amazing Web3 platforms from developers and companies thanks to support from crypto enthusiasts.</div><div><br></div><div>Web3, is the future upgrade of internet where people host thier websites and blogs on decentralized servers instead of centralized servers that are operated by one or multiple companies who can access your information without permission even centralized servers are targeted and exploited by hackers to get data or to take down your website or blog through DDoS mitigation attacks.</div><div><br></div><div>While, websites and blogs that hosted on decentralized servers are very secure as the data is encrypted and divided into number of parts then uploaded on numerous servers thus it's near impossible for hackers to exploit or take down Web3 websites and blogs including that Web3 websites and blogs are much faster and you'll never face down time.</div><div><br></div><div>The concept of Web3 is well executed in crypto currency technology but still we use centralized exchanges to sell or buy crypto currencies that negatively impacts Web3 so to provide alternative to centralized exchanges we got decentralized crypto exchanges where no company take profits instead individuals stake thier crypto tokens in liquidity pools from where you will buy tokens and the individuals who staked crypto tokens will get commission based on several factors.</div><div><br></div><div>But, decentralized exchanges are not enough as now a days people creating thousands of crypto networks and tokens which are purchased by people on daily basis so to manage them efficiently we need better Web3 products then we got DeFi - decentralized finance platforms where you can buy, sell, transfer, sell, stake, swap, your crypto currencies..</div><div><br></div><div>DEX and DeFi platforms are based on Web3 that are included in latest crypto wallets known as dApps - decentralized apps fortunately we have numerous DEX and DeFi platforms but most of them take fee when you swap or transfer your crypto currency or token based on platform and network which most people don't like.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, there are few crypto networks like Binance Smartchain and Polygon where transfer fee is in cents but still crypto tokens swap fee is usually high in most DeFi platforms so as people don't have any choice they use DeFi platforms to swap crypto currencies and crypto tokens.</div><div><br></div><div>Usually, almost all crypto currency price fluctuates according to market conditions but we also have stable crypto tokens like USDC and USDT which value set at 1$ so people who like to risk buy stable crypto tokens like USDC and USDT yet when you want to swap them for whatever reason you have to pay swap fee of 0.3% and additional bridge fee of upto $60 that's super expensive right?</div><div><br></div><div>Most DeFi platforms charge fees when you swap USDC to USDT vice versa you may be ok with it but there are some people who are facing hard times to pay hefty swap fees so if you're one of them and don't want swap and transfer fee then your are at right spot we recently found a DeFi bridge named Meson where you can swap or transfer USDC to USDT vice versa with no fees.</div><div><br></div><div>Meson is an open source safe, costless and instant DeFi bridge to swap and transfer USDC and USDT vice versa crypto tokens with no fee and slippage on all major blockchains, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Meson?
