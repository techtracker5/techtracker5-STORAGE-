</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The problem with most global companies like HTC, Samsung, Sony, Apple is there take high profit margin and spend billions on advertising and marketing it's products even pay high commission to retailers thus they put high price to manage everything and make sufficient extra profits to survive in this competition of mobile companies that is understandable but consumers don't care about all those things they first compare and find best price to buy most value for money smartphone.</div><div><br></div><div>Especially, indian mobile companies severely affected by the entry Xiaomi who used to import smartphones from china then add thier logo to sell low features smartphones with high profit margin and price in india while Xiaomi manufacture and release even assemble parts in thier own plant with value for money features at low price and margin for customers.</div><div><br></div><div>You may probably wondered how Xiaomi is able to generate profits on such low price smartphones isn't? when media outlets asked Xiaomi regarding this they simply replied we take just 2% to 4% profit even no profits on smartphones including that we don't spend much money on ads and marketing thus we are able to sell smartphones at best price possible.</div><div><br></div><div>If you're in business then you may know each company has it's own strategies and plans to sell it's products and get profits likewise Xiaomi has it's own strategies and plans they didn't want instant profits instead Xiaomi first trying to get full scale recognition from people to increase brand reputation by that they're able to get investments and make many more new category products so in future Xiaomi will get big profits for sure..</div><div><br></div><div>In fact Xiaomi already selling number of electronic products and most of them got wider attention from public as over the years Xiaomi gained millions of loyal customers and fan base with it's smartphones that immensely boosted brand identity which make people buy from Xiaomi over other companies.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The change of Motorola ownership to Lenova significantly decreased the quality of smartphones most Motorola users say Lenova damaged Motorola that luckily helped Xiaomi to reach newer heights yet Lenovo used to give tough competition to Xiaomi in early days with it's smartphones like Lenovo K3 Note and Lenova Phablet etc but now it's no match to Xiaomi.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Xiaomi only sell it's smartphones on online market in flash sales with Amazon and Flipkat etc which is one of the main reason Xiaomi able to sell it's smartphones at much less price as they don't have to pay any commission to offline retail stores while global and indian mobile companies partner with retail stores and pay them commission to sell smartphones that extra investment of mobile companies will eventually get charged from customers hidden in overall price you'll never know.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyhow, after the entry of Xiaomi in global smartphone business many china mobile companies launched thier smartphones brands world wide out of them Tecno, RealMe, iQOO, Oppo and Vivo got assuring success and giving edge to edge tough competition to Xiaomi but some china mobile companies failed like Meizu, ZTE and Gionee etc.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
