</div><div><br></div><div>In 18th century, most people in this world used machinery that require humans manual physical actions to work like for instance in order to travel from one place to another people depended on steam engine trains that is actually a machinery with different mechanisms where workers need to put coal in a fire container to generate steam that will power up train to move from its location which is actually revolutionary back then first steam engine locomotive train is invented by&nbsp;George Stephenson &amp; Richard Trevithick in year 1804 from then thanks to more inventors we have different types of trains with new technologies now.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>However, George Westinghouse adapted and promoted AC current in US and now we use wired AC current in homes as it's less expensive to generate and can transmit electricity to long distance with few energy losses but AC current is very dangerous for various reasons yet we are using in almost all countries to power up machines and home appliances.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though, most machines and home appliances require continuous flow of AC or DC current to power up and run it's mechanisms yet you can't always depend on electricity to power up home&nbsp; appliances including that there are some electronic devices that you can't always connect to electricity to use it to name a few smartphones and computers.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>On PC aka personal computers you don't get battery so you have to depend on electricity yet you can still power up PC using inverter or generator that uses batteries but on smartphones you'll get sealed Lithium-ion battery of different Mah capacity that you have to charge using electricity and once you do it you can run your smartphone without direct electricity for hours or days based on your usage.</div><div><br></div><div>Smartphone is pocket friendly electronic device alternative to PC that has multi-touch and several other technologies with operating system basically a software so alot of processes go in background due to that when you use your smartphone heavily like using big apps and play big high graphic games then it will consume and reduce battery faster which is why you have to smartly manage and use it with care as once battery is low you have to charge up using electricity for few hours until it reach full capacity.</div><div><br></div><div>Fortunately, from past few years most mobile companies releasing fast charging support with big battery smartphones packed with fast chargers which support high voltage to power up smartphone fast in less then 1 hour but when you're on move and in a location without electricity then you may not able to charge your smartphone which is why it's better to save your smartphone battery life as much as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>There are numerous methods and tricks to save battery life on smartphones foremost try to buy that Smartphone which has big battery capacity like atleast 6,000 to 7,000 Mah with super fast charging support and then as smartphones use Lithium-ion batteries they will very likely loose power storage capacity after few years so in order to not let that happen it's better to use your own official charger in safe charging mode at right electricity voltage to be in safe zone.</div><div><br></div><div>Once, you charge your smartphone make sure it only reach till 80% then disconnect it and when you start using it kindly try to not drop below 20% including that's it's better to avoid overnight charging in this way your smartphone battery will be safe and work long as per developer Paget96 found of BatteryGuru who have deep expertise on smartphone batteries.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are following our 20% to 80% battery charge cycle regularly then try to full charge your smartphone battery to 100% once in week or month in this way your smartphone will don't forget remaining battery percentage and it will also reset your battery usage statistics so that you can analyse and keep check on it.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div>Now, when put your smartphone for charging if possible try to turn on Airplane mode as it will stop all mobile and WiFi networks running in background so that your smartphone will charge quickly if you don't want to turn on Airplane mode as it will stop receiving calls and messages then atleast turn on data saver mode it will not just increase charging speed but also save alot of battery life.</div><div><br></div><div>The optimization of operating system plays major role in battery life of your smartphone if operating system is not optimized then you'll get low battery life that can only be fixed by your mobile company with software upgrade or update they mostly provide them but some don't so it's better to buy such smartphone that has stable and optimized software.</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Most people Install many big apps and HD games like PUBG, Fortnite, COD - Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Asphalt Legends etc and play them as they use heavy graphics it will drop your smartphone battery life at faster rate so it's better to stay away from then and use small size apps and games if you really serious about saving battery life of your smartphones.</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, most developers build and optimise apps or games that use low power but some don't they are packed with alot of resources that will leech your battery life so try to avoid battery cosuming apps you can check which apps or games consumer more battery life on your smartphone battery usage statistics after you figure high battery draining apps uninstall them if not possible hibernate or freeze them using best root or no root battery saver apps.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
